  <div class="poem">
    <h2 class="poem-title">Over Wine</h2>
    <p class="poem-theme">Central Theme: The objectification of women and societal expectations.</p>
    <p class="poem-content">Woman molded by man's perception. Woman's own reflection vs. how she is perceived by man. Man looking into woman as a possession. Comparison of physical objects (wine, chair) vs. the woman's intangibility. Takeaway: This poem confronts the societal pressure on women to maintain a certain image, often driven by external perceptions.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="poem">
    <h2 class="poem-title">Family Album</h2>
    <p class="poem-theme">Central Theme: Contrasting idealized love with the real, lived experiences of everyday people.</p>
    <p class="poem-content">Societal portrayals vs. actual manifestations of love. "Consumptive Romeos? Juliets Diphtherial" vs. "a [plain] portly, pince-nez'd neighbor bearing roses". Family photographs capturing ordinary moments. Takeaway: The poem emphasizes the value of authentic expressions of love and the transient nature of life, urging readers to appreciate genuine gestures over dramatized versions.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="poem">
    <h2 class="poem-title">Golden Anniversary</h2>
    <p class="poem-theme">Central Theme: Enduring, transformative love.</p>
    <p class="poem-content">From being polar opposites to a state of unified perception. "fire and water" indicating transformation. Dove symbolizing unity and peace. Takeaway: This poem celebrates the journey of love that transcends differences, redefines identities, and creates a bond that withstands the test of time.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="poem">
    <h2 class="poem-title">"I am Too Close for Him..."</h2>
    <p class="poem-theme">Central Theme: Paradox of intimacy and the complexity of relationships.</p>
    <p class="poem-content">Proximity does not always mean deep connection. "flying over him," signaling yearning and distance. "a large house is on fire" representing an unnoticed emotional crisis. Takeaway: The poem delves into the often unnoticed intricacies of relationships, emphasizing that closeness can sometimes lead to invisibility.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="poem">
    <h2 class="poem-title">"Openness" by Wislawa Szymborska</h2>
    <p class="poem-theme">Central Theme: The unseen boundaries in intimate relationships.</p>
    <p class="poem-content">The external world being more attuned to a relationship than the individuals involved. Objects like "teacups," "chairs," and "Swiftâ€™s book" observing the lovers. The erratic flight of the moth representing the unpredictability of human relationships. Takeaway: "Openness" underscores that true intimacy in relationships goes beyond physical proximity and delves into the unspoken and unseen emotions.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="poem">
    <h2 class="poem-title">"Titanettes"</h2>
    <p class="poem-theme">Central Theme: Shifting beauty standards across eras and the cyclical nature of societal ideals.</p>
    <p class="poem-content">Celebrating body diversity against the backdrop of changing societal preferences. "Daughters of the Baroque" vs. "skinny sisters." Heaven populated by "pudgy angels" and a "chubby god." Takeaway: The poem is a celebration of body diversity, highlighting the changing ideals of beauty over time, and urging individuals to recognize the value beyond trends.</p>
