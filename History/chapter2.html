<title> Contributions of European Powers During July Crisis</title>
</head>
<body>
<h1> Germany</h1>
<p>Kaiser encouraged Austro-Hungary to seize the opportunity to attack Serbia with a blank cheque. Germany did not believe the war would lead to a world war, and the united front of Germany and Austria made them think Russia would not involve themselves. When Kaiser returned from his cruise, he declared war.</p>
<h2>Motive Was:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Had to support allies Austria and Hungary.</li>
<li>Prevent itself and Austria-Hungary from being crushed by Entente powers.</li>
<li>Russia's modernization increased, undermining Schlieffen's plan.</li>
<li>Moltke and others believed it was a favorable time to go to war.</li>
<li>The war provided a good distraction, with a unifying effect to overcome domestic problems in Germany.</li>
<li>The war would improve the popularity of the Kaiser.</li>
<li>Once Russia mobilized, the Schlieffen plan would be deployed.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Germany was responsible for the war:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Urging Austria with a 'blank cheque'.</li>
<li>Declaring War.</li>
<li>Violating Belgium's neutrality.</li>
<li>Invading France.</li>
<li>Bringing Britain into the conflict.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Austria-Hungary</h1>
<p>Austria-Hungary was determined to respond as they wanted to eliminate Serbia from the Balkans.</p>
<h2>Actions of Austria-Hungary to the outbreak of war:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Exaggerated the potential threat of Serbia and wanted to make it a war.</li>
<li>Delayed responding to the assassination, which led to the July crisis.</li>
<li>Declared war 5 days after the ultimatum was sent.</li>
<li>Refused to halt military action and had negotiations with Russia, which ultimately fell through.</li>
</ul>
  <h1> Russia</h1>
<p>Sergei Sazonov saw the ultimatum as a 'European War' and wanted to take a firm stand. The Tsar ordered partial mobilization, which was followed by a general mobilization on July 30th.</p>
<h2>Contribution of Russia</h2>
<ul>
<li>Did not strain Serbian nationalism but led to instability.</li>
<li>Supported Serbia, deepening the conflict and causing Serbia to reject the ultimatum.</li>
<li>Mobilized, triggering a general European war.</li>
</ul>

<h1>France</h1>
<p>The French government was hesitant about the war and did not want to provoke a general war.</p>
<p>As Russia mobilized, Germany would declare war, as Russia and France were allies.</p>

<h1>Britain</h1>
<p>Britain was split on whether to fight Germany.</p>
<p>The Foreign Secretary, Edward Grey, wanted to go to war, but he could not mandate a British statement due to mixed opinions in parliament. When Germany invaded Belgium, the British government used the Treaty of 1839 to declare war.</p>

<h1>Historiography: Cause of WWI</h1>
<p>Responsibility for WWI was placed on the Central powers.</p>
<p>The Guilt Clause required Germany to accept responsibility as one of the aggressors.</p>
<p>Germany aimed to prove that all states were to blame and produced 40 volumes of documents. Britain produced 11 documents, France wrote their own version of events, Austria produced 8 documents, and the Soviet Union used justificatory publications.</p>
<p>Fog and Barns supported revisionist arguments by Germany.</p>
<p>The genesis of the war shows that Serbia, France, and Russia were directly involved, Austria-Hungary was fearless, and Germany and Britain were the least responsible.</p>
<p>Russia and France had motives to manipulate a crisis in the Balkans.</p>
  <h><strong>Luigi Albertini</strong></h1>
<p>Luigi Albertini wrote a response against the argument, focusing on Austria-Hungary and Germany's responsibility. He highlighted Austria's ultimatum to Serbia and Germany's 'naivety' in expecting a localized war.</p>

<h1>Fritz Fischer</h1>
<p>Germany's aims in the First World War were the focus of responsibility in Fischer's work.</p>
<p>The 'September programme,' written by Holleben, and the memorandum aimed for Germany's domination of Europe.</p>
<p>The War Council of 1912 provided evidence that Germany planned to launch a war in 1914.</p>
<p>Fischer's argument was persuasive as he linked both long-term and short-term factors.</p>
<p><strong>Criticized:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Argues 'backwards' as limited evidence to prove Germany had specific expansion aims.</li>
<li>The December War Council's evidence is limited as the Chancellor was not present.</li>
<li>Fischer holds domestic crises in Germany responsible for the war, but Holleben dismissed war as a solution for socialism.</li>
<li>It could be argued that Germany's policy lacked coherence in 1914.</li>
<li>Fischer focuses too much on Germany.</li>
</ul>

<h1> After Fischer</h1>
<p>Ritter rejected Fischer's view, while Geiss defended his works.</p>
<p>The majority agree that Germany played a pivotal role through Weltpolitik and its role in the July Crisis.</p>

<h1>John Keegan</h1>
<p>John Keegan focuses on the July Crisis.</p>
<p>According to Keegan's theory, the lack of communication during the July Crisis led to the war.</p>
<p>Austria-Hungary's reluctance to act alone caused Germany to join.</p>
<ul>
<li>Austria-Hungary wanted to punish Serbia but lacked the will to act alone.</li>
<li>Germany wanted diplomatic success but also to leave its ally stronger.</li>
<li>Russia did not want a general European War.</li>
<li>France did not mobilize but was worried that Germany would.</li>
</ul>
<p>None of the European powers communicated during the July Crisis.</p>

<h1>James Joll</h1>
<p>James Joll links factors beyond the specific control or influence of individual leaders to increase tensions caused by impersonal forces.</p>
<p>Leaders had limited options on the final day of the crisis.</p>
<p>Marxist historian focused on capitalism and imperialism as key causes.</p>

<h1>Niall Ferguson</h1>
<p>Niall Ferguson argues that Germany was moving away from militarism and highlights the Social Democratic Party.</p>
<p>The Social Democratic Party gained a lot of votes.</p>
  <h1><strong>WWI and Total War</strong></h1>
<p>Many felt the war was reasonable and justifiable, while under the impression that soldiers would have been home by Christmas.</p>
<p>The war lasted for four years, and there were several 'fronts'.</p>
<p>The Western Front stretched from England to the Swiss Alps, covering around 320 miles.</p>
<p>The 'front' existed on the Eastern front with Germany, Austria-Hungary, and Russia. Another front existed in the Balkans.</p>

<h1><strong>Failure of Schlieffen Plan</strong></h1>
<p>Unification wars convinced strategists that future wars would be short, and rapid mobilization and strong offensives were key to victory.</p>
<p>For the two-front war, German forces would be mainly in France and then transferred to deal with the Tsar.</p>
<p>Germany planned to invade neutral Belgium and then advance to Paris.</p>

<h1><strong>Failure:</strong></h1>
<ul>
<li>Belgian resistance was strong, and it took more than 2 weeks to capture Brussels.</li>
<li>Britain joined the war because of the Treaty of London 1839.</li>
<li>Germany's delay gave Britain time to organize, and channels were kept open.</li>
<li>Marching to Paris was weakened as forces were sent to the east due to Russia mobilizing faster.</li>
<li>Reservists were slowed down by exhaustion and a lack of food at the Battle of the Marne.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Battle of the Marne led to the failure of the Schlieffen Plan and ensured the war would not be short.</p>

<p>Trenches would stretch from the Alps to the Channel.</p>

<h1><strong>1915: Stalemate</strong></h1>
  <p>Stalemate continued with several attempts to break the situation, but most failed.</p>
<p>The Second Battle of Ypres saw Germany use poison gas for the first time.</p>

<h1><strong>1916: Verdun and Somme</strong></h1>
<p>Both battles failed to achieve their aims and resulted in horrific loss of life.</p>
<p><strong>Verdun:</strong></p>
<p>The Germans launched a massive attack that aimed to force the French to move towards German trenches, causing them to be shredded.</p>
<p>Philippe Petain led a French counterattack with the determination that "they shall not pass."</p>
<p>French losses: 315,000; German losses: 280,000.</p>

<p><strong>Some:</strong></p>
<p>There were a series of attacks by Douglas Haig. The attack was to take pressure off the French.</p>
<p>British losses: 418,000; German losses: 650,000; French losses: 194,000.</p>
<p>There wasn't much of a breakthrough; only 4 km of land were gained.</p>

<h1><strong>1917: USA Joins the War</strong></h1>
<p><u>Battle of Cambrai:</u></p>
<p>It marked the first use of tanks, and the British gained 8 km of land.</p>
<p>However, the tanks were mechanically unreliable and broke down, resulting in the British losing the land they had gained.</p>

<p><strong>USA entered the war in 1917:</strong></p>
<p>The German policy of unrestricted submarine warfare and the Zimmermann Telegram were the final straws.</p>
<p>The war was declared on April 4th, but troops would only enter at the end of 1917.</p>
<p>The French army was recovering from mutinies following the success of the Bolshevik Revolution in Russia.</p>
<p>Germany and Russia signed an armistice.</p>
  <h1><strong>1918:</strong></h1>
<p>With Germany near starvation due to the blockade and US troops joining the Allies, General Ludendorff rushed for a quick victory through a peace offensive.</p>
<p>Ludendorff's initial attacks were successful, with artillery bombardment followed by 'storm troopers' who were specifically trained and lightly equipped.</p>
<p>Germany broke through the lines, advancing 65 km in the Somme and coming within 80 km of Paris.</p>
<p>However, Germany had overextended itself and had no reinforcements to replace the 800,000 troops.</p>
<p>The Allies, under General Foch, utilized planes and tanks more effectively and increased their reserves.</p>
<p>'The Black Day' arrived as the Allies pushed further, causing German troops to retreat.</p>
<p>In 1918, an armistice was signed.</p>
<p>The armistice was signed on November 11th at the 11th hour.</p>
  <strong>Contained:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Termination of military hostilities within six hours of signature.</li>
<li>Immediate removal of German troops from Belgium, France, Luxembourg, and Alsace-Lorraine.</li>
<li>Removal of German troops from the Rhine with Allied troops stationed.</li>
<li>Removal of German troops from the Eastern Front.</li>
<li>Renouncement of the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk with Russia and the Treaty of Bucharest with Romania.</li>
<li>Internment of the German fleet and surrender of weapons.</li>
</ul>

<p>Foch used a railway car sliding in the forest of Compiègne for negotiations.</p>
  
  <h1><strong>Eastern Front</strong></h1>
<p>The aims of the Schlieffen Plan were to avoid fighting a two-front war.</p>
<p>Russia mobilized faster than expected, so Germany had to send troops as Austria's troops were losing.</p>
<p>Russia's position worsened when Turkey entered the war as they could cut off supply routes.</p>

<h2><strong>1915:</strong></h2>
<p>Russia suffered a defeat when Germany captured Warsaw.</p>
<p>An Austro-German offensive resulted in Russia losing 430 km of land with a million casualties.</p>
<p>A general said, 'a third of the men have no rifles.'</p>

<h2><strong>1916-1917:</strong></h2>
<p>Russia experienced the greatest success in the war due to better equipment and efforts to protect the homeland.</p>
<p><u>Brusilov Offensive:</u></p>
<p>To divert attention from Verdun, a massive offensive was launched which advanced 160 km.</p>
<p>The offensive resulted in 340,000 dead and 400,000 taken prisoner.</p>
<p>In 1917, the Tsar was forced to abdicate; the Provisional Government kept the war going. With the Bolshevik party growing, the Bolsheviks overthrew and removed Russia from the war.</p>

<h1><strong>Balkan Front</strong></h1>
<p>Austria-Hungary failed to occupy Serbia, but Bulgaria joining the Central Powers allowed for an offensive.</p>
<p>Romania joined the Allies but was quickly overrun by the Central Powers.</p>

<h1><strong>Italian Front</strong></h1>
<p>Italy joined in 1915 with the promise of land along the eastern shore.</p>
<p>The mountainous terrain made fighting difficult.</p>
<p>The Italian front placed a heavy burden on Austria-Hungary.</p>

<h1><strong>Turkey and Middle Eastern Front</strong></h1>
<p>Turkey joined to halt expansion around the Black Sea.</p>
<p>The Allies had three separate campaigns.</p>
<p><u>Gallipoli Campaign:</u></p>
<p>British warships swept through the Dardanelles, then attacked Constantinople.</p>
<p>This would allow Russia to get supplies and create a new front for attack.</p>
  
  <h1><strong>First Stage</strong></h2>
    <p>Bombardment of Turkish forts, but risks were too great. Attempted land invasion to capture peninsula. The campaign suffered from a lack of coordinated command and tactical error. The end led to no success.</p>

    <h1><strong>Second Campaign</strong></h2>
    <p>With control of oil supplies, Turks resisted. By the end of the war, British controlled Basra, Baghdad, and Mosul.</p>

    <h1><strong>Third Campaign</strong></h2>
    <p>Drive Turks back towards Turkey starting at Palestine. Aided by Arabs who used guerrilla warfare when promised independence from Turkey. T.E. Lawrence, or 'Lawrence of Arabia', was an intelligence officer who led guerrilla forces on railway and supply lines.</p>

    <h1><strong>War in the Colonial Territories</strong></h2>
    <p>Most major powers had colonies, leading to fighting in other parts of the world. Mainly in Africa, troops were fighting. In Asia, Japan attacked and occupied German islands.</p>

    <h1>How World War I Was Fought:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Size and length of time it remained operational</li>
        <li>Other conflicts were made to break the deadlock</li>
        <li>Western Front had a significant impact on ideas and attitudes</li>
    </ul>

    <h1><strong>Why Did Trench Warfare Lead to Stalemate?</strong></h2>
    <p><strong>'Race to the Sea':</strong> Settled into static warfare. Trenches were constructed to avoid machine guns. Trench warfare was deadlier for attackers. A major attack involved artillery followed by attacking 'over the top'. Barbed wire would slow progress and increase chances of getting shot. Generals' mindset was inadequate for the new warfare.</p>
