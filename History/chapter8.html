  <title>The People Community: German Society and the Third Reich</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Nazi Concept of Volksgemeinschaft</h1>
  <p>The Nazi Concept of Volksgemeinschaft originated from the spirit of 1914, which momentarily unified all classes behind the existing German government. Hitler aimed to use Volksgemeinschaft to unify the German people as a means to mobilize the country for war.</p>

  <p>Joseph Goebbels used propaganda to inculcate this mentality and ethos into the German population. The new Nazi ideology emphasized racial purity, industriousness, and reliability as prerequisites for membership in the Volksgemeinschaft.</p>

  <p>The Nazi agenda also stressed land settlement, the role of peasants, and the role of women, implying that the Nazis intended to bring about a counter-social revolution aimed at reshaping modern society. Some Marxist thinkers saw this as an attempt to hinder monopoly capitalism and strengthen the class structure.</p>

  <p>Scholars like Dahrendorf and Schoenbaum argued that the Nazi concept aimed to create a more flexible and classless society. Schoenbaum even suggested that the Nazis pursued an ideological revolution hostile to industrial society, though they ultimately resorted to war to destroy the modern world.</p>

  <p>Hitler's pursuit of Lebensraum aimed to settle Germany's surplus population, leading to deurbanization and de-industrialization. This paradoxically led to large-scale modern wars in the quest for conquest.</p>

  <p>The Third Reich represents a complex mixture of modernizing and reactionary politics.</p>

  <title>Propaganda Ministry and the Arts</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Role of the Propaganda Ministry</h1>
  <p>The Propaganda Ministry laid strict guidelines for the arts and declared theatre a public exercise subject to police supervision. Joseph Goebbels ensured that the public was exposed to a suitable cultural diet, which essentially promoted Nazi ideology.</p>

  <p>In music and arts, modern experiments were condemned, while books praised old folklore. Hitler dismissed modern art as 'degenerate' and favored pastoral scenes depicting peasants as heroic warriors.</p>

  <p>Most forms of entertainment allowed people to escape from the demands of Volksgemeinschaft. Goebbels recognized the importance of the arts and placed emphasis on radio programs, which were relatively low in cost.</p>

  <title>Education and Youth</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Changes in Education</h1>
  <p>When Bernhard Rust took control of education, attempts were made to amalgamate Catholic and Protestant schools for national unity. Parents were pressured to agree in local referenda, although opposition in the Rhineland, where Catholic clergy organized effectively, persisted.</p>

  <p>Syllabuses were revised to promote Nazi racial, political, and social prejudices. The school curriculum emphasized history, biology, and German studies, with racial science becoming compulsory. Sports also became a major subject.</p>

  <p>Jewish teachers were dismissed, and Jewish citizens were forced to leave schools due to laws aimed at 'the overcrowding of German schools and universities.'</p>

  <p>The racial state focused on building healthy bodies and led to a significant reduction of girls in grammar schools. Those who remained were encouraged to specialize in domestic science and languages.</p>

  <p>Universities remained relatively unchanged but adopted 'German Physics' while rejecting Einstein's 'Jewish' Theory of Relativity. The Nazis established a small number of special schools and institutions tasked with producing the future elite of Germany, known as Napola.</p>

  <p>Ordensburg institutions aimed to prepare individuals for future tasks and responsibilities, but they did not succeed in creating new elites.</p>

  <title>The Nazi Youth Movement</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Brainwashing Children: The Goal of the Nazi Youth Movement</h1>
  <p>The Nazi Youth Movement aimed to brainwash children and indoctrinate them with Hitler's ideology. Baldur von Schirach was responsible for controlling youth activities under the supervision of the Ministry of Interior.</p>

  <p>The Hitler Youth absorbed all younger groups except for Catholic ones. Boys between the ages of 10 and 14 had to join the Jungvolk, while girls were required to join Jungmadel. Some scholars, like Koonz, argued that this prepared girls for a lifetime in the 'second sex.'</p>

  <p>Hitler boasted that the Nazi movement had sown seeds that had deeply taken root. By the end of 1930, the Hitler Youth had become the most successful Nazi mass movement, promising a loftier life according to Wolff.</p>

  <p>The movement had grown so strong by the end of the 1930s that it could withdraw children from schools every week. It had also become a large bureaucratic organization with aging leaders, and membership had become compulsory, absorbing unwilling teenagers. However, there was a growing crisis within the Hitler Youth in the second half of the 1930s.</p>

  <title>The Peasantry</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Nazi Failure to Preserve the Peasantry</h1>
  <p>Despite the Nazi government's goal of stopping urbanization and industrialization in Germany, the peasantry was seen as the backbone of the country. Scholars like Schoenbaum argued that the support of the peasantry, along with anti-Semitism, was consistent with Nazi ideology.</p>

  <p>However, the regime was unsuccessful in its efforts to combine rearmament with the preservation of the pre-industrial peasant class. The Reich Food Estate aimed to restore peasant self-confidence by revising peasant folklore and attempting to stem migration from the countryside to the towns.</p>

  <p>Labor exchanges were authorized to prevent rural workers from accepting jobs in industry and were liable to return to their farms, but enforcement was minimal. The rural population voted against poverty, poor housing, and the back-breaking nature of farm work.</p>

  <p>The pace of urbanization quickened and exhibited characteristics of an advanced society. Walter Darre and the Nazi Agrarian Office met with failure in resettling peasants in regions of the Reich, as the Nazis aimed to build a "living wall" against Slavs. They also attempted to break the Junkers estates but faced political and economic opposition.</p>

  <title>Women and the Family in Nazi Germany</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Role of Women in Nazi Germany</h1>
  <p>The primary importance of women to the Nazi regime was as child bearers and homemakers. Hitler's aim was to conquer land for "Lebensraum" to facilitate the growth of the German population.</p>

  <p>Women were discouraged from working full-time and were instead prepared for domestic duties, including domestic science and the preservation of their health. To train women, organizations like the National Socialist Women's League (Nationalsozialistische Frauenschaft) and German Women's Enterprise (Deutsche Frauenwerk) were established.</p>

  <p>Efforts to ease married women out of the workforce began under Bruning and were intensified by Hitler, who aimed to persuade more women to return to their homes in Germany. Professional women were particularly affected, as they were barred from politics and only enjoyed "surrogate emancipation."</p>

  <p>Measures to reduce unemployment included tax concessions for those employing female domestic servants, loans for married couples, and providing support for wives to withdraw from the labor market. Women who helped their husbands on farms or in small businesses were not eligible for these loans, as their work was considered indispensable.</p>

  <p>A significant increase in the German birth rate was due to Hitler's financial inducements and discouragement of birth control methods. However, the government recognized that women would compose a significant part of the workplace once the economy picked up.</p>

  <p>Nazi ideology saw women's roles as colliding with long-term economic change, as only the unemployed could access certain loans. To address this, measures were taken to protect women's capacity and prepare younger women for their roles as future mothers. Women were encouraged to attend courses on domestic science, child care, and were subject to restrictions on the number of hours they could work in factories.</p>

  <p>During this time, the number of female doctors increased, and women were encouraged to teach again. Hess and Bormann persuaded exceptional women to take on senior posts.</p>

  <p>The Nazi regime considered the family as a "germ cell," and the concept of family, along with German law, undermined the public sphere. There was growing pressure for children to join the Hitler Youth, which was seen as a public obligation. Nazi policy towards the family accelerated as a market trend.</p>

  <p>In 1938, divorce was made easier by new laws, allowing it for reasons such as refusal to have children, eugenic weaknesses, or a three-year separation. The protection of 'Aryan Children' was enforced, banning abortion. Heinrich Himmler argued that women should be raised properly during abortion and established Lebensborn homes for pregnant women.</p>

  <title>The Workers in Nazi Germany</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Hitler's Controversial Claim and the Industrial Proletariat</h1>
  <p>Hitler made the controversial claim that the government was broken with prejudice and created a genuine people's community. This claim was essential to assess the fate of the industrial proletariat in the Third Reich.</p>

  <p>Hitler justified the dissolution of trade unions and political parties of the left as liberating the workers from bureaucratic and corrupt Marxist leaders. The benefit of union protection was that workers were forced to join the Labor Front.</p>

  <p>In each factory, there were more than 20 workers, and a council of trust was set up. They were elected annually but later disbanded as they were electing unreliable candidates. The council of trust theoretically had the power to take an employer to a local "court," but only 616 cases were brought against employers, and most were a poor substitute for trade unions.</p>

  <p>The Labor Front encouraged and exhorted the workers while maintaining an "objective appearance of socialism," combining promises of emancipation with depoliticization of industrial relations.</p>

  <p>Labor Front leisure organizations like "Strength Through Joy" existed to provide opportunities for workers to refresh themselves. Ley said it was an attempt to dispel boredom and prevent criminal activities. One of KDF's most popular policies was the launch of the Volkswagen, the people's car, with the promise of giving the car when the last payment was made.</p>

  <p>Hitler's achievement of full employment was considered his "sole gift," but it also created more problems for the regime and gave workers real economic power, which they began to exploit. New employees were often set to replace the old ones, and absenteeism and work stoppages were initially seen as stubbornness but were later interpreted as workers being isolated from other social groups, with union leaders being imprisoned.</p>

  <title>The Hitler Myth as a Factor of Integration</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Hitler's Inclusive Nation Based on Race</h1>
  <p>Hitler's major integrative factor was the creation of an inclusive nation based on race, rather than class. No single class dominated Germany during the Nazi regime.</p>

  <p>Nazi propaganda placed great emphasis on the nobility of labor and the equality of Germans. Hitler valued the workers and peasants at least as highly as the traditional ruling and professional classes.</p>
