  <h1>Chapter 2: Yalta Conference and the Polish Question</h1>

  <p>As the war came to an end, Franklin Roosevelt, Joseph Stalin, and Churchill met in Yalta to discuss four central issues that were a result of the war.</p>

  <p>The main topic at Yalta was the status of postwar Poland. The Polish government declared war on Germany on behalf of France and Britain. The two powerful governments decided to go to war and risk the lives of their people to prevent a German advance.</p>

  <h2>Issues Discussed:</h2>

  <ol>
    <li><strong>Issue 1:</strong> As the war came to an end, all prewar governments fled Poland and stayed in London. They wanted Poland back, and the West wanted to set them as a legitimate government, but as the USSR had occupation of Poland, the role of Poland being returned was in Stalin's hands.</li>

    <li><strong>Issue 2:</strong> Aimed at bringing the Red Army into the war against Japan if Japan did not surrender. This was due to Japan's fierce resistance.</li>

    <li><strong>Issue 3:</strong> Formation of the United Nations to replace the League of Nations. Roosevelt wanted an organization that was acceptable to Stalin and Churchill while being acceptable.</li>

    <li><strong>Final Question:</strong> The occupation of the German state. The allies would have control over Germany, whose future was dependent on who was in charge of the region.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Polish Questions</h2>

  <p>Poland was the thorniest, as it was brought up 7 out of 8 times in formal sessions between the three big powers.</p>

  <p>FDR and Churchill said Poland was an ally, so they should have their own government. Exiles of the previous government during the war were living in London and were open about their hatred towards the communist governments. They refused to consider a treaty with the Soviet Union.</p>

  <p>The non-aggression pact would allow Germany and the Soviet Union to split Poland in two in the hope of the Soviet Union not joining the war.</p>

  <p>Stalin knew about the nationalistic, anti-Russian attitudes of the Poles. As he moved in, the Red Army was the target of the Polish resistance. He told the western allies that the Poles were "quarrelsome."</p>

  <p>The Hitler invasion cost the USSR around 27 million lives. At Yalta, Stalin wanted to prevent a hostile Poland, so he did not want the London Poles to take power in Warsaw again. FDR and Churchill accepted the reality that eastern Europe was part of the Soviet Union's sphere of influence. Prior to Yalta, Stalin created his own Polish government in Lubin, which consisted of communists and socialists.</p>

  <p>WWII was fought on noble ideals, democracy, and self-determination. The British still had a treaty with the London Poles, but it did not consist of protecting them against the USSR, which the British government tried to express. The British still had a moral obligation to defend their foreign ally against totalitarianism, but it was trumped by the Red Army.</p>

  <p>The dispute on the Polish question of self-determination was based on Stalin. It came down to the arguments of the government, where Stalin wanted to keep the Lublin regime while FDR and Churchill wanted a provisional government in Poland. The solution came down to the government being reorganized on a democratic and provisional basis until the “free election” of a permanent government.</p>

  <title>The Ghost of Munich and Polish Borders</title>
</head>

<body>

  <h1>The Ghost of Munich</h1>

  <p>After Yalta, FDR and Churchill expected Stalin to impose the agreement, but Stalin was under the impression that Westerners had yielded to the USSR, so he saw it as resolved and did not allow the free elections to take place.</p>

  <p>Roosevelt's Republican critics made these arguments:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Roosevelt yielded Poland and the rest of eastern Europe to Stalin.</li>
    <li>Stalin broke his promise at Yalta for free elections and precipitated the Cold War.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>The Democrats had a different idea and said Roosevelt did not cede east Europe to the Soviets. They contended that the war put red troops in eastern Europe. Truman is said to follow appeasement.</p>

  <h2>The Ghost of Munich</h2>

  <p>In the autumn of 1938, Hitler took part of the Sudetenland, and if it was not satisfied, then they would declare war on them. The French military did have an alliance with Czechoslovakia, but they did not have the capacity to supply them. Chamberlain of the UK came in, and it led to the Munich Conference. After this, they thought they had avoided war, and Chamberlain said, “Peace in our time."</p>

  <p>Hitler lied, annexed the rest of Czechoslovakia, and pressured the Poles to give land. The British and French were determined to take a stand and have an alliance, so when Hitler invaded, the second world war started.</p>

  <p>Lessons from Munich were clear: a dictator could never be satisfied where appeasement only temporarily helps the appetite. As Forrestal said, “no returns on appeasement."</p>

  <p>When Stalin demanded to have his own sphere of influence in eastern Europe after the war, the west would say no due to the lessons from Munich. They concluded that acceptance would lead to further expansion. The West could not accept the USSR presence in Eastern Europe due to the non-usual division of spoils of wealth.</p>

  <p>The Soviets had their own readings. The Kremlin believed Hitler was the main target and called for alliances, but they were seen as suspicious from the west. In Moscow, the deal seems to defame Hitler to the west, and when Hitler launched his invasion, he was in control of most of Europe.</p>

  <p>For the Soviets, the lesson was that eastern Europe could not fall into the hands of hostile forces. Due to this, Stalin would not allow old regimes that were hostile or cooperated with the Nazis to run. The old order of hostile states aligned with the USSR gave way to a reality that served Moscow's interests.</p>

  <p>The west focused on the military containment of the USSR and its unwillingness to legitimize the Kremlin position in Eastern Europe. The Soviets were adamant that they would create a buffer from the capitalist west and preserve the security of their nation.</p>

  <h2>Polish Borders</h2>

  <p>When Stalin pushed on Poland's borders, he demanded that they take lands that they had lost to the Poles under the Treaty of Riga. Lord Curzon urged Poles to accept the eastern border as it would make it.</p>

  <title>German-Polish Borders, Japanese Issue, UN Questions, and the German Question</title>
</head>

<body>


  <p>Separate from the Ukrainian and Belorussian populations, Poles rejected the proposed border and made their own line. Stalin, in charge, moved the Poland border 75 miles further into the west, which was part of Germany. Stalin sought allies' stamps of approval for the Order-Neisse Line at Yalta but was not successful. The third readjustment called for the division of the USSR and the poles of East Prussia, but Stalin wanted East Prussia to be part of his spoils of war. The reasoning was that USSR and Poland suffered at the hands of Germany, so they reluctantly took it.</p>

  <p>After 1945, Soviets and Poles saw the border changes at the expense of Germany as a fait accompli. A fair number of Germans were reluctant to accept the consequences of the war. When the USSR and the West failed to reach an agreement on the political fate of unified Germany, they split Germany into 4. The East German government had to accept the new German-Polish border due to USSR control. The West wanted a unified German government and said the new government under Chancellor Konrad Adenauer was the legitimate government. The chancellor himself refused to accept the Soviet boundaries and disliked the Soviets.</p>

  <p>In late 1960, Brandt acknowledged the new borders, but for the first 42 years, no West German government accepted the legality of the transfer of German territory.</p>

  <h2>Japanese Issue</h2>

  <p>The second issue at Yalta was straightforward. The US chiefs wanted the Red Army to enter the War but they needed some prodding. Stalin said they would enter the war after 90 days of the war in Europe. Prior to this, the USSR was Japan’s next target as they already engaged in a battle at Khalkin Gol in 1939. USSR joined at the very end of the war and saw the opportunity to gain lost territories.</p>

  <h2>UN Questions</h2>

  <p>The third topic at Yalta was with the organization of the UN. Churchill and Stalin took the veto power along with the USA and France and China. All of them were given power to veto UN action. Along with this, the UN could not be used against the interest of major powers, only work when they are in concert but it rarely happened.</p>

  <p>An example was giving Hong Kong back.</p>

  <h2>German Question</h2>

  <p>The fourth question was the immediate fate of Germany. It came down to split the territories into occupation zones. Originally, it was split into 3, but France wanted a zone as they were allies so they were given part of the USA and UK area. They had two respective capitals Berlin and Vienna.</p>

  <p>The big three were satisfied with the land they got, but Yalta was a focal point of the cold war.</p>

  <h2>The Potsdam Conference</h2>

  <p>Mid-summer Berlin was in ruins, and Japan was defeated, but there was tensions between the west and Soviet Union when trying to carve out spheres of influence.</p>

  <title>Potsdam Conference and the Truman Doctrine</title>
</head>

<body>


  <p>Both sides turned into mutual suspicion, and the conference was at Berlin, capital of the third Reich, later changed to Potsdam due to destruction. The big three at Potsdam:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Joseph Stalin</li>
    <li>Harry Truman (who succeeded Roosevelt)</li>
    <li>Winston Churchill (later replaced by Clement Attlee)</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The Polish question was brought up again specifically with taking German lands, which the West had to accept, and the new government which they had to recognize but they objected towards the client government set by Stalin in East Europe in areas such as Romania and Bulgaria.</p>

  <p>The Soviets consider the transformation as a closed issue because it replaced the fascist government.</p>

  <p>There was a disagreement with the issue of reparations. Soviets wanted them to pay 20 billion from Germany, mainly focused on industrial equipment that would leave it weak and dependent on outside help. This was a disadvantage to the West as Germany could not stop Soviet expansion if this happened and become communist.</p>

  <p>USA was thinking of giving funds to Germany, but this would go straight to Soviet pockets in this plan.</p>

  <p>The solution to this was splitting Germany into different occupation zones. The Soviets would force East Germany to pay. This would lead to three years that there was no single German state.</p>

  <p>Truman and Stalin agreed at Potsdam was on Japan. Truman saw that the atomic bomb would keep Soviets out of the war. Stalin already knew about the bomb and was secretly planning to attack Japan in Manchuria and wanted to allow war with Japan.</p>

  <p>Defeat of Japan did not help the regulations as they both had suspicions of each other. The bombing of two cities led to the suspect of the US. Each disagreement and misunderstanding became a weapon of hostile acts.</p>

  <p>The Cold War was irreversable, and the conflict reached a plateau in 1947. The US declared the commitment as an economic along with military to where communism appeared.</p>

  <h2>The Truman Doctrine</h2>

  <p>When the US was faced with the prospect of communist victory in Greece, Truman said it was a turning point in American foreign policy. As WWII ended, Greece saw bitter conflict between the left and right, which was towards a communist victory.</p>

  <p>British originally had involvement in Greece but they were exhausted with the war so they placed Greece into the hands of the USA. Truman quickly jumped, but it was against the US public who expected the US military to not be in Europe. Truman knew he had to scare the hell out of American people, so he presented the “Truman speech.”</p>

  <title>The Truman Doctrine, The Marshall Plan</title>
</head>

<body>

  <h2>The Truman Doctrine</h2>

  <p>Truman explained how communism came from the center of Moscow and was spreading among other nations, so it was the duty of the US to support the free people and be a champion of democracy. He further said that if Greece became communist, then other countries would follow, invoking the “domino theory.” Turkey and the Middle East would fall, following the example of Greece.</p>

  <p>The Truman Doctrine was on a path to suppress radicalism and revolution, invoking the “domino theory” - if X falls, then Y and Z will follow. There wasn’t any clear evidence of Stalin in the Greek revolution, but he did not interfere with Greece by upholding British sphere of influence. Churchill himself said how Stalin could have interfered with Greece. Stalin found it interesting that Greece was going communist.</p>

  <p>The Truman Doctrine worked well in its first application as the economic and military aid helped the communists be defeated, and the monarchy was set back without US troops. China, on the other hand, was a different situation as the US government fell out of favor.</p>

  <h2>The Marshall Plan</h2>

  <p>Three months after the Truman Doctrine, the United States, under George Marshall's idea, intended to provide funds for rebuilding the damaged economies. The Marshall Plan was a humanitarian gesture, which many Europeans expressed with gratitude and many were grateful for decades to come. The plan also preserved the prosperity the war brought to US society. At the end of the war, the US led an international unrestricted trade but demanded a prosperous Europe would purchase US goods.</p>

  <p>The Marshall Plan complemented the Truman Doctrine as a political weapon in the containment of Soviet influence. "The other half of the same walnut" - Truman. The Marshall Plan would stymie the communist parties in Western Europe as the USSR influence was weak with fortunes coming from the Marshall Plan.</p>

  <p>The Lend-Lease program with the USSR was around 11 billion dollars. Moscow applied for economic assistance, but nothing came due to their activities in Eastern Europe. The USA was willing to extend the Marshall Plan to the east but there were some preconditions in which the money would be administered by West Europe. The USSR wanted to participate, but when Molotov, the foreign minister, learned about the plan, he did not accept because there would be US officials in East Europe, and it would infringe on national sovereignty.</p>

  <title>Soviet Rejection of Marshall Plan, Limits of Soviet Power</title>
</head>

<body>

  <h2>Soviet Rejection of Marshall Plan</h2>

  <p>Due to this, Stalin pressured Poland and Czechoslovakia to reject the Marshall Plan. In Czech, a communist coup would bring them into the Soviet orbit. In the coup, it led to murders of democratic people such as the foreign minister and had a “prima facie” that the West could not do business with the Soviet Union. Stalin's rejection also meant that East Europe would have to rebuild with their own limited resources. Moscow extended to the center of Europe, and Churchill said an “iron curtain” was across Europe from Stettin on the Baltic seas to Trieste on the Adriatic.</p>

  <h2>Limits of Soviet Power</h2>

  <p>After Stalin consolidated his position, there was a first crack. Yugoslavia broke with the Kremlin over national sovereignty. Moscow said the interests of communists should be with the USSR, but Yugoslav had their own affairs, and Tito, the leader, refused. This led for Yugoslavia to become the first communist nation in Eastern Europe to be independent from the USSR. The West saw this as “Titoism” - deviation from the international communist community. Stalin knew it was not an isolated phenomenon, so he launched a bloody purge on the national communist. Until Stalin's death, Eastern Europe was quiet.</p>

  <p>It was also evident that the division of Germany and Berlin was permanent. All talks about reunification broke down, but at first, Stalin allowed for the West to have access to West Berlin. Stalin did not like this, but West Berlin had little military value, was outgunned, although it was valuable politically and could have spearheaded pointing towards Eastern Europe along with espionage.</p>

  <p>This would lead Stalin to close all routes to West Berlin, i.e., the Berlin blockade. To counter this and not cause MAD (Mutually Assured Destruction), they came up with the Berlin Airlift. They would transport planes with an average of 4,000 tons of supplies to the cities. This would cause Stalin to yield and open West Berlin again.</p>

  <p>This crisis was one of many that would lead to war. The US assumed that the Soviet Union was preparing for a war, which was based on fear. This led to the Soviet army ensconced in the center of Europe, fulfillment of Soviet propaganda stressing the triumph of socialism throughout the world, and third is the differences of opinion between the Soviet and the West took on the character of military confrontation.</p>

  <p>The expansionist view of the Soviet state gripped the Western imagination as it was impossible to shake off. This view led for the US to argue that the USSR should be contained. As Kennan said, the Truman Doctrine and Marshall Plan worked well with containment but weren’t clear with the idea of containment. He was more on the political than military. Truman's containment was of a military nature; the USA created NATO to box the USSR with the western nations.</p>
