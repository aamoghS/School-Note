                <li>Positive Correlation: When one variable increases, the other increases.</li>
                <li>Negative Correlation: When one variable increases, the other decreases.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Causation: When one variable influences another, without a one-to-one relationship.</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Types of Democratic Regimes</h1>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Parliamentary Democracy:</strong> In this regime, the head of state is chosen through the legislative branch (the parliament). The head of state and the head of government are different officials.</li>
        <li><strong>Presidential Democracy:</strong> In this regime, the President is chosen through the election process by the people. The president is both the head of state and the head of government.</li>
        <li><strong>Federal Democracy:</strong> Power is shared between central and regional governments. Both the central and local governments have their own responsibilities and rules and are directly voted by the people.</li>
        <li><strong>Direct Democracy:</strong> Citizens are directly involved in the decision-making process. This process often occurs through referendums, where the government requires the population to vote on an issue. For example, the Brexit referendum in the UK.</li>
        <li><strong>Representative Democracy:</strong> In this type of regime, people select officials to represent their interests. There are mechanisms for accountability in representative democracies, such as impeachment and recall.</li>

    <h2>Democracy: Advancements and Regression</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Constitution:</strong> A set of rules and principles established on principles or precedents that a state must abide by. Example: In the United Kingdom, constitutional reforms allow for amends to be made to the document and provide stability over time.</li>
        <li><strong>Religion:</strong> Religion can have a powerful influence over people and societies. Example: Iran is a theocracy ruled on the foundation of Sharia law, which provides rules for Muslim life.</li>
        <li><strong>Military Forces:</strong> Refers to the ability of a group to impose power through military control. Example: Nigeria's military dictatorships have used coercion to threaten the population and impose power.</li>
        <li><strong>Legislature:</strong> The power of the legislature can vary from country to country. Example: The political elites in Russia have helped to maintain the power of the one-party system.</li>
        <li><strong>Popular Support:</strong> Refers to the degree in which one particular individual or group is endorsed by the people. It has a great influence in politics. Example: Popular support can shape the decision of government and other organizations.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Federal Systems</h2>
    <p>Federal System—A division of power between two entities. Examples: Mexico, Russia, Nigeria</p>
    <p>Benefits of a federalist system:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Shared Governance - Shared governance between regional and local can help to balance the different interests of the regions and promote harmony between them.</li>
        <li>Flexibility - Different regions can have different approaches to issues, encouraging innovation and experimentation.</li>
        <li>Decentralization - Decentralization from the federal government is important to make sure the needs of local communities are being attended.</li>
        <li>Protection of Minority Rights - Minority groups can have more influence over regional/local decisions through federalism.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Unitary Systems</h2>
    <p>Unitary System—A central government which is supreme. Examples: China, Iran, the UK</p>
    <p>Benefits of a unitary government:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Efficiency - Unitary governments exhibit more efficiency since there are not many levels of government to go through when it comes to decision-making and the adoption of policies.</li>
        <li>Simplicity - Unitary systems are usually less complex for citizens to understand as well.</li>
    </ul>
</body>
<body>
    <h1>Legitimacy and Political Stability</h1>

    <h2>Sources of Legitimacy</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Nationalism:</strong> It is a movement that emphasizes interest in a nation in particular. Example: Iranian nationalism is highly associated with the 1979 revolution, which brought a new regime to power and defined its political landscape.</li>
        <li><strong>Tradition:</strong> It is tied to long-adopted beliefs, practices, and customs from a society. Example: Russia's tradition of Imperialism, which consists of annexing other territories, is a historical legacy that is still adopted by the government today.</li>
        <li><strong>Governmental Effectiveness:</strong> Refers to the capability of the government to fulfill its goals and expectations. Example: In the UK, the government is considered to be overall qualified to perform its duties because its political institutions are considered powerful and well-established.</li>
        <li><strong>Economic Growth:</strong> Tied to the ability of the government to grow and develop domestically and internationally. Example: After the downfall of the Soviet Union in 1991, Russia had a couple of years of economic growth, which helped to legitimize its government transition.</li>
        <li><strong>Ideology:</strong> Consists of a set of values and beliefs that a group of people resonate with, and it can be political or not. Example: The Chinese government draws from the Marxist-Leninist theory to construct its party (the CPC) ideology.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How Legitimacy is Maintained</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Strong Economic Growth:</strong> For example, in Nigeria, the oil boom of the 1970s brought more legitimacy to the government (in the short-term) because the population saw an increase in jobs and economic prosperity.</li>
        <li><strong>Political Efficacy:</strong> It refers to the perception of an individual in how they can influence political decisions and outcomes. For example, UK citizens understand and believe that they play a role in the political system, contributing to political efficacy.</li>
        <li><strong>Charismatic Leadership:</strong> Leaders like Vladimir Putin in Russia legitimize their power through charisma and the ability to defend their nation against western influence.</li>
        <li><strong>Expansion of Rule of Law:</strong> For example, Mexican citizens rely on the constitution as a source of legitimacy since it unites them and puts everyone, including institutions, on the same level.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Political Stability</h2>
    <p>Political stability is the ability of the government to provide the services its people need, in order to build the public's confidence in the institution of the state. Stability is also related to "predictability" which means that a stable government acts in a way that is expected by the people.</p>

    <h1>Legitimacy and Political Stability</h1>

    <h2>Sources of Legitimacy</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Nationalism:</strong> It is a movement that emphasizes interest in a nation in particular. Example: Iranian nationalism is highly associated with the 1979 revolution, which brought a new regime to power and defined its political landscape.</li>
        <li><strong>Tradition:</strong> It is tied to long-adopted beliefs, practices, and customs from a society. Example: Russia's tradition of Imperialism, which consists of annexing other territories, is a historical legacy that is still adopted by the government today.</li>
        <li><strong>Governmental Effectiveness:</strong> Refers to the capability of the government to fulfill its goals and expectations. Example: In the UK, the government is considered to be overall qualified to perform its duties because its political institutions are considered powerful and well-established.</li>
        <li><strong>Economic Growth:</strong> Tied to the ability of the government to grow and develop domestically and internationally. Example: After the downfall of the Soviet Union in 1991, Russia had a couple of years of economic growth, which helped to legitimize its government transition.</li>
        <li><strong>Ideology:</strong> Consists of a set of values and beliefs that a group of people resonate with, and it can be political or not. Example: The Chinese government draws from the Marxist-Leninist theory to construct its party (the CPC) ideology.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How Legitimacy is Maintained</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Strong Economic Growth:</strong> For example, in Nigeria, the oil boom of the 1970s brought more legitimacy to the government (in the short-term) because the population saw an increase in jobs and economic prosperity.</li>
        <li><strong>Political Efficacy:</strong> It refers to the perception of an individual in how they can influence political decisions and outcomes. For example, UK citizens understand and believe that they play a role in the political system, contributing to political efficacy.</li>
        <li><strong>Charismatic Leadership:</strong> Leaders like Vladimir Putin in Russia legitimize their power through charisma and the ability to defend their nation against western influence.</li>
        <li><strong>Expansion of Rule of Law:</strong> For example, Mexican citizens rely on the constitution as a source of legitimacy since it unites them and puts everyone, including institutions, on the same level.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Political Stability</h2>
    <p>Political stability is the ability of the government to provide the services its people need, in order to build the public's confidence in the institution of the state. Stability is also related to "predictability" which means that a stable government acts in a way that is expected by the people.</p>
