    Near the end of the 19th century, the idea that war could not be used as a tool of diplomacy was there, but in the 20th century, war was recurring.<br>
    Both world wars had high casualties.<br>
    The change in warfare had increased the number of casualties.<br>
    Technology also brought threats to war.<br>
    At the end of WWII, the USA and the USSR were superpowers, while European nations such as Britain and France declined.<br>

    Limited War: Constrained by the way war is conducted<br>
    Confined to a geographical area<br>

    limit the weapons used<br>
    
    The USA and USSR had limited war, while Korea and Vietnam used total war.<br>

    Civil war: conflicts between two factions or regions of the same country <br>
    Typically religious, political, or ideological<br>
    Civil war comrades aim to take control via political and legal means, but this is longer than coup d'état violence.<br>
    Civil War comrades are called insurgents or incumbents.<br>

    Guerrilla warfare (Spanish for little war) was key in the 20th century.<br>
    "Unconventail warfare, as small groups of fighters would attack fewer mobile armies<br>
    For example, during the Chinese civil war, soldiers would employ these tactics.<br>
    Guerrilla warfare was common after 1945 as Asia and Africa tried to be free from colonial rule.<br>
    They used this because they had limited military resources and needed to win.<br>
    In Cold War: Communist vs. Capitalism, typically unpopular governments were set up so they would use guerrilla warfare.<br>
    Marxist masses must rise against capitalist governments, which fits the guerrilla warfare idea.<br>

    Post-Cold War, guerrilla warfare was central, specifically in Al-Quda.<br>
    Democratic political governments are vulnerable to guerrilla tactics.<br>
    Technological developments helped insurgents as they took advantage of small arms.<br>
    Economic cause: a country needs economic resources or secure markets.<br>
    Ex: Hussein invaded Kuwait<br>
    Economic Effects: War can lead to inflation or food rationing.<br>
    ex: why Germany collapsed in 1918<br>
    Social cause: war caused by different social groups in a country or region<br>
    Spanish civil war<br>
    Social effects: customs and traditions changed from wars<br>
    Ex: The end of WWI caused a shift in the status of women.<br>
    Political cause: a clash between different political factions<br>
    Ex: Spanish civil war<br>
    Political Effects: War changes how the government structure is and can completely change how it is run.<br>
    Ex: Creation of new states after World War I<br>
    Ideological Cause: A clash of ideas between different groups about how government and society should be run.<br>
    Ex: Spanish Civil War of 1936—between Fascism and Communism<br>
    Ideological Effects: War can also affect the ideological position of a country or group of people.<br>
    Ex: The WWI effect, which led to the communist revolution during the Russian Revolution of 1917<br>

    The most brutal and destructive war was World War I, which consisted of 60 declarations of war between countries.<br>

    Franco-Prussian War (1870–1871)<br>

    At the end of the Napoleonic Wars, in 1815, the Germanic states were split into 39 states, with two large states in particular. Austria and Prussia<br>

    Prussia was under Otto von Bismarck, who fought three wars to consolidate the smaller states into one unified German state while making them the dominant Germanic state over Austria.<br>

    Prussia defeated Denmark and Austria in 1864, and Prussia in 1871.<br>

    The Franco-Prussian War ended with Prussia's army showing it was powerful while humiliating France.<br>

    At Sedan, a French army had to surrender 80,000 men, while at Metz, 150,000 men had to surrender.<br>

    Paris was under siege, but the use of modern technology was clear. Prussia used railways to deliver men and materials to the battlefield, and Paris collapsed due to an economic blockade.<br>

    Political and socioeconomic problems followed the defeat of France. The French would start the political revanche movement because they wanted revenge.<br>

    From the war, the outcomes were shown.<br>

    German had the potential to be dominant.<br>
    The emphasis in modern warfare has to be on rapid mobilization and fast deployment.<br>
    The general staff of the army had to be competent and able to plan.<br>
    Use of railways to deploy men and equipment<br>
    Unification wars Modern warfare relies on movement and is relatively short.<br>

    Germany was a democratic monarchy; the system is authoritarian. The Kaiser and Chancellor have power, while the Reichstag's power is limited.<br>

    They became the strongest industrial power in Europe and even overtook Britain.<br>

    There were social problems in Germany.<br>

    Socio-economic tensions between the working class, middle class, and aristocratic government<br>

    Junkers and Prussian landowners retained political dominance and promoted militarism and allegiance to the Kaiser.<br>

    Congress of Berlin of 1884: How Africa Would Be Carved Up by European<br>

    France looked for an alliance with Russia to ‘contain’ Germany.<br>

    Britain: well-established parliamentary democracy<br>

    monarchy, retaining limited powers.<br>

    In the 1900s, Britain declined in international trade and primary economic power.<br>

    The USA and Germany had become industrial powerhouses.<br>

    Britain had similar socio-economic issues, but the degree of flexibility<br>
    The British Government was alert to popular opinion and the press.<br>

    The change in the balance of power led to a change in foreign policy.<br>

    Followed ‘Splendid Isolation—not wanting to be drawn into conflicts between other nations<br>

    British interests were in the dominance of the sea, so the navy was powerful.<br>

    Austria-Hungary <br>

    Dual monarchy: emperor over the Austro-Hungarian Empire along with parliament<br>

    bureaucratic and inefficient.<br>

    Slow economic growth<br>

    The key problem was a national rivalry.<br>

    The 19th century had nationalist forces, and the demands for nationalist forces along with military weakness caused Austria-Hungary to form.<br>

    They did expand to the Balkans, as Slavic people wanted to unite with their people.<br>

    The empire was multi-national and lacked cohesion economically, politically, and socially. The main concern was the hostility and aggression of Serbia.<br>

    Russia, defender of slave people<br>

    Russia: autocratic ‘divive monarchy’<br>

    Limited democracy was given, but no working conditions were made.<br>

    After defeat in Crimea and the Russo-Japanese War, Russia was not a ‘great military power.<br>

    Russia's strength was the people, but they were unhappy as Russia was focused on Slavic nationalism in the Balkans.<br>

    Turkey<br>

    The Ottoman Empire was the sick man of Europe.<br>

    Sultan was undermined in most areas, and the regime was corrupt and ineffective.<br>

    Revolts by national and Islamic groups could not be contained, which caused weakness to show.<br>

    Europeans exploited this for commercial value.<br>

    Sultan was overthrown in 1909 by the ‘Young Turks', a group aiming to modernize Turkey economically and politically.<br>

    With the decay of the Ottoman Empire, there was a power vacuum in territories ruled predominantly by the Ottomans.<br>

    The European powers' best idea was for Turkey to modernize while Russia promoted the Balkan States.<br>

    Long-term causes of WWI<br>

    The creation of Germany made European nations nervous about their power.<br>

    France was hostile as they lost the war and Alsace-Lorraine.<br>

    Kaiser Wilhelm I did not push aggressive foreign policy.<br>

    Bismarck would create a web of alliances to protect Germany from future attacks and allow Germany to consolidate power.<br>

    The main aim was to keep France isolated and remain allies with Russia to prevent a two-front war.<br>

    Weltpolitik: make the German army and state more powerful while diverting the German population from social and political problems at home.<br>

    Imperialism<br>

    Europe increased its dominance in Africa through economic motives.<br>

    The territorial acquisition was increased due to social Darwinian and nationalistic competition.<br>

    Kaiser caused great offense in Britain with the Jameson Raid.<br>

    Germany Pushed for more navy so the British would increase navy.<br>

    The British would sign an alliance with Japan, which allowed them to bring the royal navy back and enter France, which would settle with rivalry in Africa.<br>
