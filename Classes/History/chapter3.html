<div class="bold">1. Technological Impacts on the War</div>

<p><span class="bold">Air Warfare:</span></p>
<p>The First World War marked the first significant use of aircraft in combat. Initially, planes were used for reconnaissance, but their role quickly expanded.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Zeppelins:</span> These German airships were initially seen as a significant threat. They were used for bombing raids over Britain, targeting civilian and industrial areas. Their advantage was their range and payload capacity.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Fighter Aces:</span> As aerial combat became more common, certain pilots, known as "aces," gained fame for their skills. Figures like the "Red Baron" from Germany became household names. These individuals were often used for propaganda purposes, boosting morale on the home front.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Artillery:</span></p>
<p>Artillery was the dominant force on the WWI battlefield. The constant barrage and shelling led to the establishment of trench systems as a defense mechanism.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Creeping Barrage:</span> This tactic involved artillery fire moving slowly ahead of the infantry as they advanced. It aimed to clear enemy defenses just before the infantry arrived.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Fire Control:</span> As the war progressed, techniques were developed to better coordinate and direct artillery fire, maximizing its impact.</p>

<!-- Section: Chemical Warfare -->
<p><span class="bold">Chemical Warfare:</span></p>
<p>The use of chemical weapons marked a dark chapter in warfare. These weapons were designed more to incapacitate and instill fear than to kill, although many did die from their effects.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Chlorine Gas:</span> Introduced by the Germans, it caused severe respiratory problems, leading to suffocation.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Mustard Gas:</span> It was a vesicant that caused severe chemical burns and other long-term health problems.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Phosgene:</span> Deadlier than chlorine, it was used later in the war.</p>
<p><span class="bold">5. Significance of Artillery</span></p>
<p><span class="bold">Artillery's role cannot be overstated:</span></p>
<p><span class="underline">Trench Warfare:</span> The power of artillery made open advances deadly, leading to the establishment of trenches.</p>
<p><span class="underline">Counter-Battery Fire:</span> Artillery was used to target enemy artillery, trying to gain an advantage in the ongoing duel of the guns.</p>
<p><span class="underline">Supporting Attacks:</span> Artillery barrages were used to precede infantry attacks, aiming to weaken enemy defenses.</p>

<!-- Section 6: Employment of Chemical Warfare -->
<p><span class="bold">6. Employment of Chemical Warfare</span></p>
<p><span class="bold">Chemical warfare introduced a terrifying dimension to the battlefield:</span></p>
<p><span class="underline">Gas Masks:</span> The introduction of poison gas led to the rapid development and deployment of gas masks to protect troops.</p>
<p><span class="underline">Tactical Use:</span> Gas was used to create confusion, weaken defenses, or disrupt enemy attacks.</p>
<p><span class="underline">Long-Term Impact:</span> Beyond the immediate effects, chemical weapons left many survivors with long-term health issues.</p>
