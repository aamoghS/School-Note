    <h1>Chapter 3: The Cold War and Allied Occupation</h1>

    <p>The Cold War originated in Europe, where tensions mounted between the East and West over the status of Germany, Poland, and other countries. There were conflicts in Asia. The US policy in East Asia was to eliminate Japanese militarism and support the Chinese nation-state government under Jiang Jieshi. After 5 years, the US was confronted with affairs different from what they envisioned after the war.</p>

    <p>The nationalist regime was detested by Chinese communists, and the chairman, Mao Zedong, became the founder of the People's Republic of China on October 1st. Nine months later, Korea would have the same issue between communists and Democrats. The rivals of the Cold War clashed on the field in ways of proxies.</p>

    <h2>Allied Occupation of Japan</h2>

    <p>The Allied occupation of Japan for seven years was unique in the annals of history. Resichauer said, “Never before had one advanced nation reform the supposed failures of another advanced nation.” The US policy in Japan was constructive and benevolent, though it had punitive aspects.</p>

    <p>Japan expected the war, as they had never been defeated or occupied. Japan feared US brutality, and the US feared Japanese hostility. The two nations made amends in a short time and endured cooperation. It was caused by the generous treatment of US forces and the receptivity of the Japanese themselves. They welcomed the opportunity to rid themselves of militarism and appreciated Western goods such as chocolate bars. Securing the active support of US authorities was necessary to return the emperor to the throne. Japan was cooperative because of their emperor, as they had a habit of obeying and had been implored to be cooperative.</p>

    <h2>Occupation of Japan</h2>

    <p>Washington had already planned a reform program. The Allied occupation of Japan was dominated by the US, but other nations were not allowed to have a role in it. General Douglas MacArthur was appointed Supreme Commander of Allied Powers (SCAP) and would maintain the Japanese cabinet.</p>

    <p>Unlike Germany, Japan was not divided into separate occupations, as the US denied the Soviet Union an occupation zone in Japan.</p>

    <p>The objectives of the US-controlled occupation were demilitarization and democratization. Demilitarization was first implemented in the Japanese army and navy. Three million Japanese soldiers were repatriated to Japan by US ships. They also got rid of militarism by putting wartime leaders on trial. Similar to the Nuremberg Trials, 28 leading figures were found guilty of planning aggression and crimes against humanity.</p>

    <p>The occupation reformers also wanted to rid the ideology of Shintoism and emperor worship. The emperor was called upon to renounce imperial divinity. Other steps were taken to abolish “State Shinto," and they took steps to censor these ideas further.</p>

    <p>Democratization was complex, but the first major step was writing the Constitution. The MacArthur Staff drafted one, and it would provide a parliamentary system similar to Britain. The people were made sovereign, and the emperor was no longer the symbol of the state, i.e., had no political authority.</p>

    <p>All laws were passed by a majority in the House of Representatives in the Diet. The Constitution makes provisions for the civil rights of Japanese citizens. Article 9 outlawed war and forbade Japan to maintain land, sea, or air forces, which MacArthur ordered but was endorsed by other leaders.</p>

    <p>The economic reforms included dismantling the old zaibatsu (financial cartels that dominated the prewar Japanese economy), land reform to redistribute farmland for poor farmers, and labor reform, which created a trade union movement.</p>

    <h2>Education Reforms and Anomalies in the Occupation of Japan</h2>

    <p>There were education reforms intended to make Japan more democratic. The various reforms were successful as they addressed real needs in Japan as Japan desired them.</p>

    <p>An anomaly with the occupation is that democracy is being implemented by military command. It censured the Japanese press, disallowed free speech, and issued directives to the Japanese government. Along with this, MacArthur's role as a reformer was anomalous. MacArthur played the role of the Almighty, but he claimed to like the Japanese people, but his manner was condescending towards them.</p>

    <p>He viewed the Japanese as 12-year-olds who had to show democracy. Although he did possess genuine reformist zeal and contributed greatly to the success,</p>

    <p>Japanese militarism was eliminated by the USA, but communism spread to China and Korea. This would lead the USA to reverse its policy toward Japan and play a role in the containment of communism.</p>

    <p>Many Japanese historians and revisionists argue that the US exercised power in postwar Japan through many democratic reforms. Japan emerged as a democratic society with passionate pacifism and large military security.</p>

    <h2>The Civil War in China</h2>

    <p>The victory in China over the nationalist government was between communists and nationalists. The nationalist party, under Jiang Jieshi, wanted to exterminate the communist party led by Mao. The communists barely escaped annihilation and traveled 6,000 miles. When the war with Japan started, Mao said to make a united front, and the communist party would grow due to leadership and the mobilization of guerrilla warfare. The nationalist government had little control and was used mostly against the communist army.</p>

    <p>When the war ended, the USA supported the Jiang government and sent Hurley to serve as a mediator. He was successful in bringing the rivals to the negotiating table but did not find a solution. Truman then sent Marshall, despite being on paper for a cease-fire. The conflict led to a full-on civil war.</p>

    <!-- ... (rest of the text) -->
    <!-- ... (previous HTML structure) -->

    <p>It was destined for failure as Jiang refused to share power while Mao demanded the formation of a coalition government. Jiang wanted to reduce the communist forces. The USA was weakened by a lack of neutrality and aid to the nationalists, which would alienate the communists. Jiang caused the war because he saw that the only solution was military force.</p>

    <p>The nationalists had good reason to be confident, as they were 3 to 1 in the communist army and had economic aid from the USA. The war took a shift a year later in Manchuria, as when Russia signed a treaty to leave, they took resources, and the communist army moved into the city, occupying it. The Soviets would provide the PLA with Japanese weapons, which were helpful and helped defeat the nationalists.</p>

    <p>PLA also captured large amounts of US weapons while retreating. The communist force was better disciplined and had more morale. The nationalist army also had vulnerability due to having to spread their forces too thin to maintain defensive positions.</p>

    <p>After Machria ended, the war shifted towards communist favor, and the last battle was at Xuzhou. The battle had let the nationalists lose 200,000 men, and the communists won decisively.</p>

    <p>From here, the forces were retreating, and Jiang fled to Taiwan. Mao would then proclaim the PRC, with Beijing as the capital.</p>

    <p>It would become part of the Cold War, as the new communist government would not rest until Taiwan was defeated. The two Chinas were allied with each other, which was a major issue.</p>

    <p>The outcome of the civil war was that neither nation was invaded militarily. After the US pulled out troops, they did not give much aid and gave economic aid. The USA provided around $2 billion.</p>

    <p>The USSR was ambivalent towards China and signed a treaty that recognized the Jiang rule of China at the end of the Second World War. Their looting did not help both sides, and Stalin did not help except by giving arms to the communist party in China. Stalin would have been happier with a weak nationalist government, as it could be exploited, rather than a strong communist regime.</p>

    <p>The popular support of the peasantry for the communists, high morale, and the curricula of the nationalist regime were factors that contributed to the communists' winning. Along with this, there was runaway inflation, which demoralized the Chinese people. The communists had 85 percent of the population, which supported the land-reconstruction program, while the nationalists did not go into any of these plans.</p>

    <h2>Political Repercussions and the Korean War</h2>

    <p>China had political repercussions in the US, and before the civil war ended, the US had testimony from Chinese people, and they were all unanimous in their criticism of the Jiang regime. The Truman administration knew and would give aid, but if they stopped giving aid, then Truman would abandon a worthy ally. The Republican Party would blame Truman for losing China; McCarthy would blame the communist sympathizers in the State Department.</p>

    <p>The loss of China intensified the mentality of the public as it drove the Truman administration into foreign policy. Later, he was faced with a Vietnamese communist revolt in Korea. He responded immediately and forcefully.</p>
<h2>The Korean War</h2>

    <p>Nine months after the Chinese communist invasion, the North Korean forces launched an attack on South Korea. The US and its allies responded swiftly and halted forceful expansion by using the UN Charter. Korea became the first battleground and the first major threat for an all-out war between East and West. Although it was a stalemate, the Korean War was a product of the Cold War and had effects.</p>

    <p>The Korean conflict started near the last days of the war when the USA and USSR divided the Korean peninsula at the thirty-eighth parallel. The division was agreed upon by the US and the Soviets in Potsdam as a temporary arrangement after the Japanese forces surrendered in Korea. It would only last until they could agree, but the Korean communists established a government in the north and carried out a land reform program.</p>

    <p>The first South Korean president spent years in exile, but it would take forty years to establish a democracy. On the island of Cheju, socialists were leading protests, which caused the US forces to fire on the demonstrators. Such an insurrection started on April 3, which saw the US kill around 14,000 South Koreans, 30,000 from the US, and 80,000 islanders. 40,000 fled to Japan. On the fiftieth anniversary of the massacre, the president apologized to the residents of the island.</p>

    <p>Political disorder in the South exacerbated the economic problems, runaway inflation, and demand for land redistribution. This would make Korean unification impossible. The US and Soviets agreed to set up a provisional government that would operate under both nations, but it was a cold war scene as both would accuse each other. The Soviets accused the US military of fostering undemocratic regimes, and the US accused the USSR. The Soviets proposed the immediate withdrawal of both Soviet and US occupation, but the US was worried about the USSR having a better-organized state in the north, so they wanted a free election to be carried out.</p>

    <p>The US took the issue of Korea to the United Nations, and the UN general assembly passed a non-binding free election, which the UN would see. The communist regime in the North would not permit the UN, so the South was proclaimed the legitimate government of all of Korea. North Korea tried to do the same, and both superpowers would remove forces until 1949.</p>

    <!-- ... (previous HTML structure) -->

    <p>By the end of 1940, the policy of containment began to show cracks when the Soviet Union successfully tested an atomic bomb and the civil war in China came to an end with a communist victory. The people of the US believed that the communist triumph was engineered by Moscow.</p>

    <p>The Republicans charged that Truman's loss of China to communists, similar to Roosevelt's loss of Eastern Europe to the Soviets, created a perception of dominoes falling. The reactionary Republican criticism caused the Truman administration to stand up to communism more than before.</p>

    <p>In April 1950, Turkey received recommendations from the National Security Council, known as NSC-68, saying that there could be no meaningful negotiations with the Kremlin until it changed its policies. They recommended developing the hydrogen bomb to counter the Soviet Union bomb. The program would cause a large increase in taxes, so the people would have to be mobilized around the idea of sacrifice. This was all based on the assumption that people did not want to accept the communism that was forced on them, so they would accept the US people. This, however, was false, as seen in Cuba and Vietnam, where the population refused to rally for our cause.</p>

    <p>The National Security Council created duplicates of the work of the state departments. During the Kennedy administration, there was a tendency for presidents to consult the NSC rather than the professionals in the State Department. The State Department experts on the USSR people would be ambassadors and later serve in Moscow. They saw the Soviet Union as a threat to Western Europe.</p>

    <!-- ... (previous HTML structure) -->

    <p>The first test came two months after the president approved NSC-68 when the Korean War broke out. Top US military leaders had concluded that Korea was not sufficiently important to US national interests. The assessment was based on defending Europe and Japan and on the insufficient strength of our ground forces, which were from Alaska through Japan to the Philippines. Acheson could hardly falter, as his critics would later charge what he said, but it was in US policy. North Korea and the USSR knew the limitations they were facing.</p>

    <p>When the invasion came, the US acted like they were off guard and saw it as a surprise attack. Both military intelligence and monitored the North Korean troop movement, and preparations had evidence of the attack. Both generals withheld the information to maximize the psychological impact of a “surprise attack."</p>

    <p>It is not clear what roles the Soviet Union and China had, but neither troop was involved at first. The communist state did receive political, economic, and military support from the Soviet Union. The US and its allies concluded that it was Soviet aggression and blamed Stalin. Testimonies by people who were close to Stalin after the collapse of the Soviet Union stated that Kim II Kung did visit Stalin and sought to support the invasion of South Korea. Stalin's response was less clear. Stalin did acknowledge the war plans but did not give specific instructions. He did not block his proposed war plan but did not enthusiastically support it either.</p>

    <p>Stalin then told Kim to consult with Mao. Kim told Mao they raised no objections and speculated that the United States would not intervene with a small, distant country. After he secured general acquiescence from both leaders, he would attack.</p>

    <!-- ... (previous HTML structure) -->

    <p>Stalin opposed the attack on the South by saying the “38th parallel should be peaceful, and Stalin feared a war that would give the United States a pretext to get involved. Stalin only accepted my attack, as he thought the war could be contained on the peninsula. Kim was convinced that the war was strong enough to achieve a communist victory through a full offensive and assumed the US lacked the will to rescue South Korea.</p>

    <p>The US rapidly swung into action. Truman ordered US naval and air support from nearby bases in Japan to help the South Korean army and took the issue of North Korean aggression to the UN. As the USSR boycotted the meeting because China was not involved, the Security Council based its resolution on condemning the invasion and calling for withdrawal. Two days later, they passed a new law for nations to contribute forces known as “police action”. It was unlikely that the USSR would have a seat either way.</p>

    <p>In virtue of the second resolution, US military involvement in Korea was authorized by the United Nations. Although Truman had ordered US troops into Korea a day before it was authorized by the UN, the Soviet Union made use of it and called it an act of aggression, content that the war was started by the UN and South Korea was a violation of the UN Charter because two of the five big nations were not there.</p>

    <p>The authors of the NSC welcomed the outbreak of the war as it allowed the United States to roll back on communism. Most weapons were supplied by the US in the campaign against the UN, and all forces were put under MacArthur.</p>

    <!-- ... (previous HTML structure) -->

    <p>The swift response belied the Acheson statement and reflected the thinking of NSC-68. The Truman administration wanted to write off Korea but decided to meet with the commission on containment.</p>

    <p>The US determined that South Korea's defense was vital to the places in Asia, specifically if the USSR's influence over Korea would endanger Japan.</p>

    <p>Turmanna also saw the defense of Korea as important to maintain the credibility and defense commitments of the US and the NATO alliance.</p>

    <p>He likened the situation in Korea to Nazi aggression and invoked the lesson of Munich. Appreciation does not bring peace, but more aggression.</p>

    <p>Both the South Koreans and the first US troops lacked military equipment, but MacArthur’s landing on Inchon behind communist lines helped the war effort and pushed the communists behind the 38th parallel.</p>

    <p>The US government made a critical decision: to pursue or not pursue. MacArthur and Rhee wanted to eliminate the communist regime, so they wanted to push forward, but it was not part of the UN resolution. Along with this, it would risk intervention by communist China and the USSR. The Truman ambassador at the UN rejected proposals by the USSR and India that would give the USSR and India an armistice and China a seat in the UN. Truman got a non-binding resolution saying that nationwide elections would ensure the conditions of stability.</p>

    <p>Truman would authorize the entry of the South Korean army and grant the same authority to MacArthur on the condition that they would halt their advances if either force entered. When entering North Korea, it became a US war objective, and the goal was to eliminate the communist regime in the north and unify the use of the military in Korea. MacArthur kept advancing and started to pace towards the boundary between Korea and China.</p>

    <p>He would ignore the warnings from those in Beijing who threatened intervention and skeptics in Washington.</p>

    <!-- ... (previous HTML structure) -->

    <p>His aggressive pursuit would raise concern with Truman’s advisors, and they met on Wake Island to urge caution against provoking the Chinese or Soviets. MacArthur predicted an imminent victory and assured Truman that the Chinese would intervene and that many would not get across. Around 50k</p>

    <p>With US forces advancing towards the Chinese border, China would send troops under the label of "volunteers,” which would disclaim its official involvement in the war. MacArthur reports Badlt underestimated the number of troops, and the Chinese army of 300,000+ opened a counterattack. This pushed the USA from 250 miles to 50 miles south of the 38th parallel.</p>

    <p>The Chinese force was much larger and provoked a dispute with Truman about military policy. MacArthur was frustrated that an imminent victory was denied and that he would not bomb the communists. The president and his allies feared it would lead to WWIII or nuclear war. MacArthur publicly criticized the policy of limited warfare.</p>

    <p>In 1951, MacArthur exceeded his authority by declaring that he would use a necessary weapon against the Chinese, which led Truman to dismiss the general and make it clear to the president that he had authority over the military.</p>

    <p>MacArthur's insubordination would have initiated an all-out war between the East and west.</p>

    <!-- ... (previous HTML structure) -->

    <p>It was alleged that he was dismissed due to his advocating the use of atomic bombs, but there were occasions when the president considered using the bombs on Korea. Truman said in a conference that he would use the bomb; in the UN, he said he would use the bomb, and the new president Eisenhower considered using the bomb to break a stalemate.</p>

    <p>The dismissal of Major Brouhjt had no chance, and the new general Ridgway forced the Chinese to retreat to the 38th parallel. After this, there was a state shutdown for the next two years, which took a toll on the civilian population of Korea due to the US bombing cities.</p>

    <p>The military deadlock broke peace talks, and both the USSR and the USA negotiated for a ceasefire. The talks were on and off for two years. The commissar wanted the 38th, but it came down to the existing battle leader, which gave South Korea more land. The second issue was that the communists wanted all providers, but the US said they should decide if they wanted to return. The truce talks were deadlocked. This led to propaganda, as around 40,000 North Korean POWs did not want to be repatriated, and the communists tried to present this mass defection.</p>

    <p>After the new leadership in the USSR after Stalin's death and in the USA with the inauguration of Eisenhower, the two sides were friendly and ended the stalemate. The agreement stated that they would allow each other to return home. It was delayed as Rhee tried to sabotage it because he wanted to fight and release 25,000 who rejected repentance to the north. China responded with a new offensive, but the US was there to pacify</p>

    <p>The fighting ended with the final battle as the truce ended, which was now a DMZ (demilitarized zone). The truth did not officially end the war, and it would halt it.</p>

    <p>The Korean War ended roughly along the same line, where the cost was enormous: over 35,000 men in combat for South Korea, 300,000 in North Korea, 52,000 in China, and 900,000 in the USA.</p>

    <!-- ... (previous HTML structure) -->

    <p>The fatalities were as high as 2 million, and it was a short victory on either side; both could claim important achievements.</p>
    
    <p>The US had help from allies who stood against communist aggression. This would strengthen NATO. The Chinese emerged with the prestige that their army was superior to western</p>
    
    <p>The war for Korea in the north and south was disastrous, as the war was fought with great ferocity that did not hesitate to inflict vicious punishment on their enemies, but civilians were punished as they were thought to be informers or collaborators.</p>
    
    <p>Many atrocities were committed by both sides and caused bitterness that would persist for years to come. Along with the great death and destruction, the existence of their country would be permanent, and there would be no reduction of tensions.</p>

    <h2>Title: The United States and the Cold War in Asia</h2>
    
    <p>The communist victory in China was a setback for US foreign policy. The threat of US power in East Asia was made greater when China and the USSR agreed on a 30-year alliance. The US was confronted with a global communist movement that doubled in size as China joined.</p>
    
    <p>China was envisioned as a strong, united pillar of democracy in China, but it was shattered, so they used Japan as a strategic partner and base of operations.</p>

    <p>When it was apparent that the communists would defeat the nationalists, the US occupation policy in Japan took a far-right to where they would rebuild them to stop the spread of communism. Prior, they did not help economically, but they started to help with economic aid in other ways.</p>

    <p>The reverse course can be seen in restrictions against "zaibatsu,” which was a ban on general labor strikes. The security of Japan became urgent for the US, and President Barack Obama authorized the formation of a 75,000-person police reserve, which would reverse his original policy.</p>

    <p>This was disappointing to Japan, as they wanted to return to pacifism.</p>

    <p>The USA and Japan would sign a new treaty with Japan in 1951 to frame a new relationship. This would end the Allied occupation. The communist nations objected to the final terms because they were not informed, so they did not sign them.</p>

    <p>The treaty went into effect in 1952 with the US-Japan Mutual Security Pact, so the US would guarantee Japan's security and would remain in Japan to stop communism. They also retained control over Okinawa. Japan became a child of the Cold War, both militarily and politically.</p>

    <p>In Japan, political polarization was mirrored by the left and right. The right favored political and military ties to the United States and knew Korea was a threat. While the left-wing university students did not like the rearmament and US forces on Japan's society As Japan was a conservative party, 40,000 US forces remained on US military bases in Japan.</p>

    <!-- ... (previous HTML structure) -->

    <p>The Korean War had a lasting impact on the Cold War. The fact that the two sides fought for the militarization of the Cold War “defense” budgets of both the United States and the Soviet Union skyrocketed and grew. The military budget of China would also grow and remain on a war footing years later.</p>

    <p>The consequence of the Korean War was the tension between the United States and the People's Republic of China. The possibility of accommodation existed until they fought in Korea. They were both accused of aggression, and both increased. For PCR, the US military promoted US imperialism and was a threat to Chinese diplomacy and security policy. For the United States, the threat was the communists, and they wanted to contain it.</p>

    <p>This became a central feature of US-Asia policy for the next 25 years. It was reflected in making Japan a major US ally and base of operations in Asia. And a commitment to defend the Chinese on the island of Taiwan against an attack from the mainland. The growing involvement in Vietnam in efforts to defeat the communist movement also required the USA.</p>

    <p>The United States locked itself into a Cold War position in Asia and wanted to stop its spread in the communist world. To counter the communists in Asia, strengthen their own, and resist US intervention.</p>
