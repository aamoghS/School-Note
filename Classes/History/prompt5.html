<ul>
  <li><strong>Traditionalist Views:</strong> Hitler promoted a traditionalist role for women in society, epitomized by the "Three Ks" policy (Kinder, KÃ¼che, Kirche - Children, Kitchen, Church). He believed that women should primarily focus on childbearing and homemaking, adhering to traditional gender roles.</li>
  <li><strong>Impact on Women:</strong> These policies had tangible impacts on women, leading to a rise in birth rates and the restriction of their roles in society. Women were encouraged to embrace their roles as mothers and homemakers, while career opportunities were limited.</li>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Policies Towards Jews:</strong> Hitler implemented a series of discriminatory laws, known as the Nuremberg Laws, to marginalize and persecute Jews. Events like Kristallnacht and the Final Solution represented the extreme culmination of these policies, with the goal of exterminating Jews.</li>
  <li><strong>Policies Towards Other Minorities:</strong> Hitler's policies extended beyond Jews to include other minorities like the Romani people and disabled individuals. The Aktion T4 program targeted disabled individuals, while the Porajmos affected the Romani community. These policies aimed to further the goal of creating a racially pure society.</li>
