<h1>Cuban History and U.S. Involvement</h1>
  <p>Cuba was once a U.S. protectorate and gained dominance on the island after the Spanish-American War. Prior to the occupation, the USA was a trading partner and invested $30 million in the Cuban economy, leading to their intervention during the Cuban rebellion that eventually resulted in a war.</p>

  <p>The U.S. Senate initially opposed the idea of American occupation in Cuba but changed their stance after the war, authorizing a three-year military occupation. Cuba achieved independence in 1902, but the Platt Amendment, introduced by Orville Platt of Connecticut, granted the U.S. the right of military intervention under specific circumstances such as civil war, uncleanliness, and dangerous diseases in Cuba.</p>

  <p>The Platt Amendment also imposed restrictions on the capacity of the Cuban government to incur debt and engage in treaties with third powers, while allowing the U.S. to establish naval bases on the island, strategically securing Panama.</p>

  <p>The close economic association between the USA and Cuba was evident as the USA had investments in sugar mills, giving U.S. companies 60% of Cuban sugar production by the 1920s. American companies also held large landholdings beyond sugar, including Cuban subsidiaries in electricity, tobacco, and other utilities.</p>

  <p>Benefits for Cuba emerged as the U.S. raised the standard of living by 1925, reaching half of the USA standard. Military doctors aided in conquering yellow fever, a scourge for many generations. The USA also built a railway along the length of the island.</p>

  <p>This close association also meant that the USA would use Cuba as a scapegoat. U.S. corruption in elections was blamed on Cuba, and the behavior was seen as irritating. Many Americans went to Cuba thinking they were bringing prosperity and tax evasion. A large Cuban middle class became disillusioned, consisting of people who spent years in exile when preaching nationalism.</p>

  <p>Cuban nationalism took an anti-American turn as they claimed the U.S. had cheated them of victory, and each new incident of intervention created new waves of resentment. At the University of Havana, students were told that national regeneration was thwarted by "dollar diplomacy."</p>

  <p>The anti-American sentiment of Cuban nationalists persisted through 1950, although the Platt Amendment was dead, and U.S. domination was less notable. Nationalists tended to dwell on past wrongs, and Welles' treatment of Martin was still notable. Martin was corrupt but represented the revolution, and it seemed the USA betrayed Cuba.</p>

  <p>In the years of the Castro revolution, the USA did not play a major role. The USA was not involved in Batista's second coup d'Ã©tat, but intelligence was active after. The CIA helped set up an anticommunist agency in the government, BRAC. Che Guevara drew his own conclusions on the events, thinking the USA would have harsh reactions to the new nationalist revolution.</p>

  <p>USA government policy towards the Castro movement was ambiguous, as some believed Castro was a communist and should be destroyed. Gardner suggested having Castro assassinated, but Batista said they were Cuba's issues, so they could not do it. Other members of the government had friendly attitudes, shared even among the CIA. J.C. King, head of the CIA, hoped Castro was liberal.</p>

  <p>The United States presented a divided front towards Castro, allowing him to use the division as molders of public opinion. Castro met with Matthews, and he helped create widespread sympathy for the rebellion, enabling the sale of arms that affected Batista. By the end of 1958, Batista began to disintegrate due to corruption and military skill. The US government made attempts to get Batista back and give power to a junta of generals, avoiding bloodshed. Earl Smith would later say that Batista had no alternative but to leave, hastily devising plans for transition. Batista agreed, having made a considerable amount of money outside of Cuba and not wanting to fight.</p>

  <p>In the end of 1958, Batista began to disintegrate due to corruption and military skill. The U.S. government made attempts to bring Batista back and give power to a junta of generals to avoid bloodshed. Earl Smith later stated that Batista had no alternative but to leave and only hastily devised plans for transition. Batista agreed, having made a considerable amount of money outside of Cuba and not wanting to fight.</p>

  <p>Before Batista left, Cantillo tried to reach an armistice while the CIA was busy bribing Batista's enemies to run the country. Last-minute plans led to the army crumbling, and enthusiasm for Castro grew. As Castro made a good impression on the director of the CIA, Castro was made prime minister while he was in Havana, and the major positions in the government were filled with liberals.</p>

  <p>The U.S. reaction was ambiguous, but they gave Castro the benefit of the doubt. The new ambassador stated that Castro was not a communist prior to meeting him and described him as a terrific person.</p>

  <p>There was some expressed hostility to the new Cuba in the United States, and Castro exploited this to strengthen his position with the new Cuban opinion. This made Americans angry that Eisenhower did not meet with Castro.</p>

  <p>The transition in Cuba from open to closed came fast. In 1959, Cuba started agrarian reform by taking over large estates and giving land to peasants. They sent a political note of protest to the USA, demanding compensation for dispossessed landowners of American and Cuban origin. Castro was criticized for failing to call elections, but he was directing abortive expeditions against the dictatorship in the Dominican Republic.</p>

  <p>In May, Castro dismissed liberal ministers from the cabinet and had the first clash with the Cuban judiciary over a habeas corpus case. The chief of the Cuban air force later claimed to the USA that communism started to take over, and Castro hounded his own nominee who stated that Castro turned to communism.</p>

  <p>The former chief of Cuba's air force flew with a B-25 bomber to drop pamphlets on the city. He was shot down, and it killed a few Cubans, leading to insults between the USA and Cuba. After Castro took power, Mikoyan came to Havana and included a commercial arrangement between Russia and Cuba. Following this, Eisenhower approved Cuban exiles for invasion.</p>

  <p>In 1960, when Cuba asked to refine and process Russian oil over Venezuelan oil, the USA refused. Castro nationalized the refineries, so Eisenhower cut off the sugar quota, making Cuba's sugar price higher than any. Eisenhower later embargoed other items, and the Bay of Pigs invasion was deployed in May 1961. Castro then proclaimed Cuba as a socialist state.</p>

  <p>Castro and Guevara, as leading figures, ousted those who were anticommunist and almost made anticommunism a crime. Castro had a strong hold on Cuban opinion, and his position was unquestioned.</p>

  <p>Some historians state that Castro had been a communist for years, as he proclaimed on Colombian radio that it was a communist revolution and professed belief in Marxism. Castro also mentioned that he read Marx and Lenin while studying as a law student, which solidified his identification as a communist.</p>

  <p>Along with this, Castro's brother Raul had been a member of the Cuban communist youth, and Castro had many influential communist friends. When communists saw that Castro would win, they began to make alliances. Castro did assure that he had been a Marxist for years as he was being challenged due to his past with political gangsterism with Marxists.</p>

  <p>The communist party did not actively help in the fight against Batista, but their leaders became ministers in the government. Castro's speeches did not sound like Marx, but he wanted to found a movement based on people taking action. On July 26, Castro's first major attack, it quickly grew from just a few dozen to tens of thousands when he reached Havana. Anyone could grow bread and call himself a Fidelista. There was no congress, only a few officers, and Castro had to keep an eye open for communists.</p>

  <p>Fascist techniques were used in the early days of the Cuban revolution, and the Castro cult had all the same characterizations. Castro's movement gained initial support from organized workers. The temptation for Castro to move towards communism was strong as he knew it would infuriate the USA. Castro started to put communists into the ranks of the Cuban government.</p>

  <p>Castro's past life made him choose between Fidelismo and communism, and he ultimately chose communism. The brutality of communism seemed not to trouble him, but it was made clear as Batista was charged with war crimes.</p>

  <p>The BRAC director was shot without trial, and a communist, Acosta, was made commander of the old fortress before Castro was in the city. Communist instructors were moved into the army and built the institution.</p>

  <p>Memories show that the US did not take any action in 1959 as they saw the Castro movement as unique and did not know what to do, so they waited a year. There were talks about overthrowing Castro, but there was no direct USA involvement to overthrow Castro; rather, it was Cuban citizens.</p>

  <p>The dictator of the Dominican Republic, Trujillo, did launch an unsuccessful invasion, but there was no proof of American involvement. When the Cuban air force dropped pamphlets and was shot down, Cubans changed it to a "bombing" on the Cuban people. Castro's path was determined by historical vendettas.</p>

  <p>The stability of the system has continued since 1961 but was different from 1959. The revolution had the chief aim to end complete reliance on the sugar economy and laid emphasis on diverse crops more than ever. Many would forget that the Cuban obsessive question in American politics prior to the Civil War and Cuba's independence in 1870 and 1890 was a major problem in US politics.</p>
