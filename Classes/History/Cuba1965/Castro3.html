  <h1>What were the most significant features of Castro's economic policies?</h1>

  <p>A significant proportion shared Castro's conviction that the government had a mission to help Cuba improve and serve its people. Castro led redistribution policies, including healthcare, which benefited lower incomes and solidified his regime.</p>

  <p>Castro admitted his failures, but the people focused on the success of the new policies. Castro's policies and nationalism in the face of US power helped legitimize his rule.</p>

  <h2>Early Years (1959-1968)</h2>

  <p>The new government moved quickly to benefit supporters, specifically the poorest section.</p>

  <h3>Agriculture</h3>

  <p>In March, a minimum wage was set for sugar-cane cutters, and the Agrarian Reform Act was enacted for land reform. Latifundia were broken up, with owners retaining 402 hectares while the rest was expropriated.</p>

  <p>Forty percent of farmland was expropriated and divided into individual plots of 27 hectares (67 acres) for plantation workers and small farmers. Larger ranches and plantations were to be run as state farms. This was a moderate land reform, but the landowning class opposed the reform act, and the US government complained that the compensation was inadequate.</p>

  <p>The US attempted to destroy Cuba's sugar industry by cutting the sugar quota, prompting Castro to nationalize all major properties on the island. In response, the USA imposed a ban on all exports to Cuba. The Soviet Union agreed to purchase Cuban sugar for 6 per pound, aiding in long-term planning, but Cuba had to concentrate on sugar.</p>

  <p>Before the 1959 revolution, unemployment was high in rural areas, but the new government reduced it. In mid-1960, there was a labor shortage, and production began to fall as material incentives were replaced by "moral incentives." Castro called for mass mobilization for work in sugar fields and other sectors of the economy.</p>

  <h3>Industry</h3>

  <p>After 1959, real wages for non-agricultural workers rose, and rents were reduced by 50 percent. Utility companies were taken over, and prices were reduced. After Mikoyan of the Soviet Union visited Cuba, trade agreements were made, and 300,000 tons of Soviet oil were sent to Cuba. When foreign-owned oil refineries refused to process, Castro nationalized them and later socialized all major industries.</p>

  <p>Castro stated that these policies were necessary for national security and saw a "command economy" as the quickest way to ensure economic growth. Castro's early economic policy focused on the rapid industrialization seen as necessary as the Cuban economy declined, threatening the fulfillment of social policies for health, housing, and education.</p>

  <p>By the end of 1960, 80 percent of Cuba's industry was under state control, and state enterprises produced 90 percent of Cuba's exports. In 1959, Guevara was made the director of the national bank and later the minister of industries. There was a debate among leaders on how to bring diversification and industrialization, with two main models: 'endogenous and exogenous models.' Guevara favored the endogenous model, as Cuba's link to the Soviet bloc meant it could jump to socialism.</p>

  <p>Central State ministries were established with the Planning Board (Juceplan). Juceplan was instructed to draw up a plan for 1962 and draft a 4-year plan. Bethell said the plans were unrealistic and unrealizable.</p>

  <p>In the first years, there was an increase in consumption for poorer sections as they gained access to better food and housing. When Castro visited the Soviet Union, their plans were abandoned, and ministers debated on how to solve problems. Soviet assistance was given to concentrate on sugar again, leading to Guevara leaving his post in 1965.</p>

  <p>By early 1968, there was an economic crisis mainly caused by the Soviet Union reducing its supplies.</p>

  <h1>The Soviet Camp 1968-90 (80)</h1>

  <h2>Agriculture</h2>

  <p>From 1960 to 1990, sugar production grew by 40 percent, and the industry employed over 375,000 people. Unpaid overtime became necessary, and material incentives were introduced. In 1966, the Soviet Union agreed to buy 5 million tonnes, but the investment involved only provided 3.7 million tonnes. Castro launched a plan to increase the sugar harvest to 10 million, lasting from 1969 to 1970. Although they failed to reach the unrealistic target, they achieved 8.5 million tonnes, and the following year it was 5.9 million tonnes. After 1970, the sugar market went up, constituting 80 percent of all Cuba's exports.</p>

  <h2>Industry</h2>

  <p>By 1968, Cuba was dependent on the Soviet Union and was in debt by 1970. Castro moved closer to the Soviet Union, and the government turned to Soviet economic advisers. When Alexei Kosygin visited Cuba, they were already integrated due to the supply of oil. In 1972, Cuba joined Comecon, the trading union of communist states. Castro went to Moscow and signed a 15-year agreement that increased the Soviet subsidy in the Cuban economy.</p>

  <h1>Title 5.11: How Successful Were Castroâ€™s Economic Policies</h1>

  <h2>Agriculture</h2>

  <p>Sugar production faced challenges, and the harvest started to decline. However, when the Soviet Union signed long-term agreements, sugar prices stabilized, and production increased.</p>

  <h2>Industry</h2>

  <p>In 1962, when the Cuban economy crashed, the Castro government froze prices and had to ration consumer products. The fair distribution of food was a first in Cuba and was opposed by other states due to inequalities and poverty. As the Cuban economy declined further in 1963 due to imports of machinery and the decline of the sugar economy, a balance-of-payment crisis emerged. The replacement of money incentives for workers with moral ones was ineffective, as workers were paid the same. Guevara's plans were foiled by a US embargo as there was no alternative source.</p>

  <h1>The Soviet Camp 1968-80</h1>

  <h2>Agriculture</h2>

  <p>Problems in agriculture persisted due to policy changes in the mid-1960s. Production in cattle and forestry declined, and fishing, once the best performer, also saw a decline. In 1970, the Cuban economy was in crisis, and trades with the USSR were 30 percent lower due to sugar prices.</p>

  <h2>Industry</h2>

  <p>In the late 1970s to 1980, a new management system was introduced, providing more autonomy to managers. This led to increased productivity and work time, as bonuses and higher wages were paid. The economy prospered during the first half of the 1970s, experiencing good economic and industrial growth with an annual growth rate of 4.1 percent.</p>

  <h1>What were the Main Social Policies in Castro's Cuba?</h1>

  <p>When Castro took power, Cuba was ranked top 5 in Latin America for literacy, infant mortality, and life expectancy. However, these statistics were misleading, as most services were concentrated in Havana, and conditions and services in rural areas differed.</p>

  <h2>Living Standards</h2>

  <p>Castro's policies of redistribution were successful, providing jobs and addressing unemployment. Prices were kept low, and there was outstanding improvement in living standards in rural areas.</p>

  <h2>Health Care</h2>

  <p>Health care was a successful policy in the Castro government, established for every citizen with free healthcare for all. Although free healthcare existed, efforts were made to expand it to rural areas. Political and military mobilizations disrupted the expansion of medical services. By 1981, the infant mortality rate fell to 18.5 per 1000.</p>

  <h2>Housing</h2>

  <p>Before 1959, only 15 percent of citizens had running water, and 9 percent of households had electricity. The revolutionary government's housing initiatives were less successful due to inefficiencies in construction and production, as the government prioritized hospitals. The Cuban population increased, and 27,000 units were built each year. In 1973, there was a high of 21 units reached but declined in 1980.</p>

  <h1>5.13: Impact of Castro's Policies Towards Women, Ethnic and Other Minorities, and Religion</h1>

  <h2>Women</h2>

  <p>The lives of women under Castro changed as they were allowed to easily divorce, access free abortions, and the labor force doubled. Cuban women were guaranteed equal pay, and the Women Commission on Employment monitored discrimination and hiring. The highest-paid jobs were restricted to men on the grounds that they would harm women's health, with salaries 15 percent lower. There was an increase in women throughout the education system, with 60 percent of university students being female. Women instructors in medicine outnumbered men, but they were under-represented in engineering and over-represented in school teaching and humanities.</p>

  <p>The Federation of Cuban Women (FMC) was set up to help change sexist opinions. The FMC played a role in getting the Family Code adopted in 1975, designed to equalize the status of spouses in the family, with husbands sharing half of family chores. However, the persistence of Latin American machismo and stereotyping still existed, and women's participation in politics was significantly less equal than in the workplace.</p>

  <h2>Black People</h2>

  <p>Castro's programs and manifestos did not allude to color, but after 1959, black people became an important achievement of the regime. In 1959, his proclamation against discrimination called for a campaign against racial discrimination, stating that there was no significance. The new government repealed laws that enforced discrimination, but Castro did not support black separatism. Social and economic policies of the government were weak in the black and mulatto population. Surveys showed that support for the Castro government was greater among black people than white. However, leaders in 1959 were predominantly white, and women and black individuals were still under-represented in both the party and state. By 1979, only four out of 14 members of the Politburo of PCC were black.</p>

  <h1>Same-Sex Relations in Cuba</h1>

  <p>Same-sex relations are not illegal, but there was homophobia. Views altered since the revolution, initially seen as 'bourgeois decadence' from capitalism. The Revolutionary Armed Forces recruited gay men into military units to contribute to production, intended as an alternative for those refusing military service. In 1967, Castro disbanded these camps due to criticism. Discrimination persisted, and in 1971, the government declared same-sex relationships incompatible, leading to expulsions from jobs. The Supreme Court overturned this in 1975, and a more liberal approach was promoted by Hart. In the second half of the 1970s, same-sex relationships were questioned in various ways. The Centro Nacional de EducaciÃ³n Sexual was founded on the initiative of the Cuban Womenâ€™s Federation to encourage a more enlightened outlook on sexual orientation and undermine sexual prejudices. The work done by CNES contributed to removing same-sex acts as a criminal offense.</p>

  <h1>What Impact Have the Policies of Cuban Revolution Had on Education, Young People, and Arts?</h1>

  <h2>Education</h2>

  <p>Education was one of Castro's impressive achievements, addressing Cuba's ill-educated population. During the Moncada barracks incident, Castro promised reform and an end to illiteracy. The drive started with the 'Year of Education' in 1961. The revolutionary government took over private and church schools, recruiting over 100,000 volunteer student teachers who were teenagers. Despite being targets of US-sponsored revolutionaries, more than 40 were killed. These teachers successfully taught over 1 million to read and write. Over 3,000 schools were built in the first year, and 300,000 children attended school. The literacy campaign and school reforms continued throughout the adult system, with Soviet assistance developing an improved education system. Average education levels increased from the sixth-grade level in the 1964 labor census to the eighth-grade level in the 1979 census. Despite challenges, improvements were made, thanks in part to key figures like Jose Ramon Fernandez.</p>

  <h2>The Media and Arts</h2>

  <p>In 1960, mass media came under Castro's control. The only avenue of criticism allowed was the letter to editor pages, which had to relate to specific problems. There was greater freedom of expression and publication in the arts and academic world for those who supported the revolution. Castro emphasized that culture was everything but against the revolution is nothing.</p>

  <h1>5.15: How Far is Cuba a Castroist State Authoritarian?</h1>

  <p>The Cuban state under Castro has been described as a communist dictatorship, authoritarian democracy, and a guided democracy. The siege conditions resulted from US hostility, and Castro feared that a private enterprise economy and a multi-party system would allow the USA back. Castro claimed that the people's government had come to power but also stressed that people were not ready to assume government. The revolutionary vanguard would carry out policies on behalf of the people. The Cuban political system shares characteristics of an authoritarian government, although recent developments suggest a move away from strict authoritarianism.</p>

  <h1>Cuba and Democracy</h1>

  <p>Prior to the Castro revolution, Cubans were disenchanted with the corrupt party system and external dependence that allowed the USA to dominate the Cuban economy. Like Marti and the Fidelistas, they believed elections were less important than what the government does for the people. Mass meetings after 1959 saw people rejecting elections. Through Castro's one-party communist/populist system, there were limits on individual and collective freedoms.</p>

  <h1>Constitution and Elections</h1>

  <p>During a visit to the USA in 1959, Castro announced the suspension of elections.</p>

  <h1>The Constitution and Poder Popular</h1>

  <p>In 1976, a new constitution was introduced with a three-tier system of Poder Popular, including municipal, provincial, and national assemblies to allow democratic decision-making. Municipal elections were direct. Citizens and mass organizations nominated candidates for different levels of representation. The democracy had four elements: political participation, economic equality, merging of civil and political society, and imperative mandates. Balfort argues that reforms did not shift power, and the first meeting of the new national assembly happened in 1976.</p>
