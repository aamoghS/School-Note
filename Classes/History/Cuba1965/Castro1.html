<h2>Title 5.1: How Conditions in Cuba Before 1953 Contributed to Castroâ€™s Rise to Power</h2>

<p>Castro's rise to power was unexpected, considering the initial lack of resources and early mistakes in the revolt. The three-year period allowed his movement to gain strength, facing armed forces supporting a brutal military dictatorship. The origins of a single-party state in Cuba can be traced back to the political and economic problems existing before 1956.</p>

<h3>Title: Situation Before 1933</h3>

<p>During the 19th century, the independence movement in Cuba grew. An unsuccessful revolt against Spanish rule was followed by a second revolt led by Jose Marti. Since Cuba was Spain's last colony, they had an easier chance. When the USA intervened, the rebels knew they were going to win.</p>

<p>Cuba replaced one colonial power with another due to the Platt Amendment, allowing the USA to claim the right to intervene in Cuban affairs. The USA did not grant the new Republic of Cuba formal independence and insisted on including the Platt Amendment in the new Cuban constitution.</p>

<p>The USA intervened four times, ensuring the Cuban government followed policies favorable to US investments. Cuban politicians were corrupt, and elections were rigged, leading to two radical movements based on Marti's anti-imperialism.</p>

<h3>Title: The Revolution of 1933-34</h3>

<p>In August 1933, unrest forced Machado to resign and flee to the USA. Subsequently, the USA established a conservative-dominated and US provisional government headed by Carlos Manuel de Cespedes. Protests and strikes continued, leading to a coup by sub-officers on September 4th. Students and civilian leaders proclaimed a new Provisional government led by Ramon Grau San Martin.</p>

<p>Grau's government was sworn in on September 10th and issued a manifesto promising national sovereignty and a new constitution for a "new Cuba." The Platt Amendment was abolished, and prices were reduced, causing concern among business people.</p>

<h2>Title: Batista Counter-Revolution 1934</h2>

<p>The leader of the NCO group in the counter-revolution of 1934 was Batista, who led a revolt. The USA did not recognize the Grau government due to its radical left reforms. The US ambassador persuaded Batista to take power, leveraging his control with the claim that the new government would protect US and Cuban interests. Batista then transferred his support to Carlos Mendieta, a politician recognized by the USA.</p>

<h2>Title: Puppet Presidents 1934-1940</h2>

<p>Batista and the army held the real power behind the civilian puppet presidents. As students resumed protests, Batista used the army to suppress opponents, leading to urban guerrilla movements. Mendieta and Batista imposed martial law, banning unions and executing leaders, including the shooting of guitarists.</p>

<p>Grau formed a middle-class movement called Autenticos. The communists, later renamed PSP, agreed to cooperate with Batista and abandoned revolutionary politics.</p>

<h2>Title: New Constitution, New Coup, 1940-1952</h2>

<p>Batista organized elections for a constituent assembly to draft a new constitution. When the new assembly met, Batista became president, but Grau and Autenticos later won the 1944 election, leading to US intervention.</p>

<p>Grau's government abandoned reforms, and corruption persisted. Chibas formed the more radical PRC Ortodoxo.</p>

<p>The 1948 elections were won by Autenticos, becoming the most corrupt and undemocratic. Batista led another coup and ruled directly until 1959.</p>

<h2>Title 5.2: The Most Significant Stages in Castro's Struggle Against Batista Dictatorship</h2>

<p>Batista's coup in 1952 faced little resistance from parties or the general public, with Fidel Castro being the sole opposition figure.</p>

<h3>Title: Castro and Moncada Attack</h3>

<p>Fidel Castro and his brother Raul led 165 youth in an attack on the Moncada army barracks to obtain weapons. The attempt failed, resulting in the death of half of the attackers. Castro and 100 others were put on trial, where Castro assumed leadership.</p>

<p>His speech, 'History Will Absolve Me,' became the manifesto of the movement and outlined 'five revolutionary laws' that would be implemented if the attack succeeded. Of the accused, 26 were found guilty, and Castro was sentenced to 15 years.</p>

<p>Batista won the 1954 election and suppressed political opposition. In 1955-56, armed groups like DRE and OA were formed to resist Batista's brutal repression, but Castro's movement sought to end Batista's dictatorship.</p>

<h3>Title: The July 26 Movement</h3>

<p>Fidel and Raul Castro, among many prisoners released by Batista to improve his image, formed a new movement called Chibasismo in Mexico with the aim of overthrowing Batista. In Mexico, Che Guevara, a loyal collaborator, became an international symbol for rebellion.</p>

<p>By February, Castro began training his 'army,' despite arrests and subsequent releases. Following the raid, Castro decided to take his band of revolutionaries to Cuba on an old yacht named Granma.</p>

<h2>Title: From Mexico to Sierra Maestra</h2>

<p>Castro arranged an armed rebellion under Pais's control, intending it to coincide with his arrival in Cuba. However, the initial movement was crushed, resulting in casualties among Castro's men upon his arrival.</p>

<p>Surviving Fidelistas helped Castro organize a campaign of guerrilla warfare. Batista responded by clearing peasants from the lower slopes of mountains, targeting revolutionary individuals. Successful attacks allowed Castro to plan larger offensives.</p>

<p>Reports by Matthews boosted Batista's opponents, attracting additional recruits by highlighting Castro's successes. Sympathy and respect toward poor peasants provided valuable support.</p>

<h2>Title: The Urban Resistance</h2>

<p>Castro organized 'civic resistance' on a national scale to garner support from workers and the middle class. Pais controlled the movement and collaborated with the Ortodoxos.</p>

<p>Before being gunned down by Batista's police, Pais persuaded leading figures to issue a joint peace pact, calling for a revolutionary front to force Batista from power. In early 1958, communists supported Castro, and plans for a general strike in cities were discussed. Perez became the new leader, and the time was ripe.</p>

<p>Castro allowed the planned strike to proceed. Him and Perez signed a manifesto, "Total War Against Tyranny," calling for the strike as the revolution entered its final stages. The manifesto also outlined the final political plans.</p>

<p>The police and army were prepared, and the uprising was defeated. This failure led Castro to focus on guerrilla warfare, with the working class becoming a crucial part of the resistance against Batista.</p>

<h2>Title: The Final Stage</h2>

<p>Cuba was on the verge of revolution, and Castro's announcement further isolated Batista as economic allies were affected by Castro's actions.</p>

<p>Four other guerrilla fronts opened up with rebel bands, successfully gaining local recruits. Batista launched a massive liquidation campaign to crush Castro's forces but failed.</p>

<p>During the offensive, representatives of leading opposition groups met to organize a united front against Batista. The 'Pact of Caracas' by Castro was recognized as the principal leader of the anti-Batista movement.</p>

<h2>Title: Castro Counter Offensive</h2>

<p>By August 1958, the government offensive had collapsed. Castro's forces launched a counter-offensive, overrunning government forces and taking control of provincial towns.</p>

<p>Castro then turned his attention to the west and Havana. Batista increased the use of terror, prompting more people to join the urban resistance.</p>

<p>By the end of 1958, the guerrilla army numbered around 50,000 and controlled the countryside. This led to military plots against Batista, forcing him and his family to flee. After a failed US-backed coup, Castro declared, "The revolution begins now," asserting that the USA would not dominate Cuban history.</p>

<h2>Title 5.3: How Significant Was the Role of Ideology in Castro's Rise to Power</h2>

<p>Castro did adopt communist ideology, but nationalism held more importance in his ideology than socialism. Marti's influence was more significant than Marxist ideology.</p>

<h2>Title: Manifestos</h2>

<p>Castro considered manifestos essential, seeing propaganda as the soul of every struggle.</p>

<p>Castro's attack on the Moncada barracks was inspired by patriotism, with aims similar to Guiteras and Marti. In the 1930s, Guiteras advocated for radical reforms with vague socialist undertones. Castro was part of the radical Cuban nationalist tradition.</p>

<p>Castro's second manifesto in 'History Will Absolve Me' developed ideas and promised agrarian reform. It aimed to transfer public utilities from USA hands to Cuban hands.</p>

<p>The two formal manifestos issued by Castro in Mexico showed no signs of communism and lacked a clear ideology. While Castro desired radical social revolution, he rejected the idea that it was inspired by communism.</p>

<p>During 1957-58 in Sierra, Radio Rebelde offered broad outlines of policies and reforms rather than a specific program. The manifesto issued on March 12 aimed to help prepare an unsuccessful general strike and repeated elements of the 'History Will Absolve Me' speech. The Caracas Pact was signed by all but the communist group, which opposed Batista.</p>

<p>Serious contacts between Castro and Cubans started in 1958, with Carlos Rodriguez joining rebels in Sierra and growing cooperation with the PSP.</p>

<h2>Title: Nationalism and Cubiana</h2>

<p>The main source of inspiration for Castro was a radical version of Cuban nationalism. The first war of independence introduced the idea of Cubiana. Castro believed that the July movement was the custodian of Cubiana and the vanguard needed to achieve Cuban independence.</p>

<p>Castro's political ideas were nationalist and less radical. Nationalist struggles inspired Castro, and with his own movement taking a similar stance, it mobilized the masses against powerful traditional elites.</p>

<h2>Title 5.4: Why Was Castro Successful in His Bid to Overthrow Batista</h2>

<h2>Title: Military and Political Factors</h2>

<p>One reason for Castro's success was the guerrilla movement and the quality of commanders. Additionally, where they began operations, there were only a few rural guards, and the local population in Havana was terrorized by them. The growing success forced Batista to divert troops to rural areas.</p>

<p>Batista's brutality and repression increased opposition and garnered additional support. As the rebel movement grew, dissent within army ranks also increased, contributing to Batista's challenges.</p>

<p>Batista faced mounting popular opposition and armed resistance. Problems within the army ranks started to undermine Batista's confidence.</p>

<h2>Title: Economic Development</h2>

<p>Castro's success was influenced by the economic situation in Cuba. The decline in the price of sugar led to a recession. The trade treaty of 1934, which removed tariffs, damaged the Cuban economy, leading to increased unemployment.</p>

<h2>Title: Role of the USA</h2>

<p>Castro's eventual success was affected by the attitude of the US government. In late 1957, the government decided that, to protect US investments in Cuba, Batista had to give way to a caretaker government acceptable to US interests.</p>

<p>On December 9, 1957, a financier attempted but failed to persuade Batista to retire. The US started to reduce support and imposed an arms embargo, making it difficult for both Batista and Castro.</p>

<h2>Title: Popular Support</h2>

<p>Apart from the growing success of the rebel army, deteriorating economic conditions in Cuba and Batista's brutal repression allowed Castro to rise to power.</p>

<p>Castro's campaign was initially limited to rural areas, where they respected peasants, specifically executing brutal persecutors. This strategy enabled them to gain support and avoid detection in the early stages of guerrilla war. Support gradually spread to urban areas, gaining the support of the middle class.</p>

<p>Castro achieved support through skillful and coordinated use of radio and press. Since his student days, Castro recognized the importance of radio and publicly staged events with Matthews. When the reports came, it showed that Castro was stage-managed. Regular broadcasts from 1958 by Radio Rebelde were popular, providing accurate reports of military clashes and contributing to the growth of support.</p>

<p>In the end, Castro called for national regeneration and economic reforms to win supporters among Cuban businesses. The successful use of modern mass media won rebels' support, and Castro's slow journey was filled with large cheering crowds.</p>
