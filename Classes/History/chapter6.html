    <h1>The Impact of the Third Reich</h1>
    <p>When it fell, it was a catalyst for the Cold War. The left saw Nazism as a variant of Marxism.</p>
    <p>Orthodox Marxists perceived it as a mass movement manipulated by business and finance.</p>
    <p>Haller argued that the most powerful idea was that "national and social were not opposites."</p>
    <p>Rausching argued that Nazism was a revolutionary power.</p>

    <h1>West Germany's Perspective</h1>
    <p>West Germany saw Nazism as a variant of totalitarianism, similar to communism.</p>
    <p>It had elements of "total ideology," including a single mass party, a terrorist secret police, a monopoly of mass communications, a monopoly of weapons, and a centrally planned economy.</p>

    <h1>Totalitarian Definition</h1>
    <p>The totalitarian definition was dominant in Western research.</p>
    <p>Fischer was the father of the structuralist school of historians that dominated for 30 years.</p>
    <p>Wehler, in his study of the Kaiserreich, avoided personality and focused on politics, economy, and society.</p>
    <p>He argued that Hitler was not an aberration in German history.</p>
    <p>Momsen and Broszat said Nazi society functioned, and Hitler needs to be factored in.</p>
    <p>Title: Can the Third Reich be "Historicized"?</p>

    <h1>Origins and Rise of National Socialism</h1>
    <p>German racial superiority traces back to nationalism and romanticism.</p>
    <p>In the second half of the nineteenth century, a new volkish or German racial ideology emerged.</p>
    <p>Nazi ideology was a mix of social Darwinism and pseudo-scientific studies of race.</p>
    <p>Gobineau, in "The Inequality of Races of Man" (1853-1855), claimed the racial supremacy of 'Aryan' and racial purity of life in the nation.</p>
    <p>Chamberlain in 1899 said it was essential to preserve the racial survival and greatness of Germany.</p>
    <p>Title: The Bismarckian Reich</p>

    <h1>The Bismarckian Reich</h1>
    <p>Wehler stated that the constitution Bismarck made in 1871 failed to satisfy the German people.</p>
    <p>The problem was that the German people didn't understand the problems of society.</p>
    <p>When Bismarck left, the manipulation of the Reichstag was in the Kaiser's hands, but he failed.</p>
    <p>There was polarization between the left and right, with one wanting to develop more democracy while the other embraced volkish ideology.</p>

    <h1>Wilhelmine Germany</h1>
    <p>Wilhelmine Germany was a state where the rule of law was a reality.</p>
    <p>In 1917, when Germany's economy was severely declining and in desperate search for a scapegoat, Jews were vulnerable.</p>

    <h1>The German Revolution</h1>
    <p>In 1918, to avoid military defeat, a parliamentary government was proposed to make an armistice.</p>
    <p>Due to strikes, the new government under Ebert could only survive by basing its power.</p>
    <p>Ebert did not create a republican people's militia and did not purge the bureaucracy, which allowed Hitler to take charge.</p>
    <p>The communist uprising also fueled fear of socialism.</p>

    <h1>Adolf Hitler and the Formation of NSDAP</h1>
    <p>Hitler was blinded for a while in 1918 and spent time in the hospital during the German Revolution.</p>
    <p>Hitler was employed by the military as a V-Mann to counter Bolshevik propaganda in Munich but joined the German Workers' Party.</p>
    <p>He worked full time and started to make changes such as changing the name and the structure to where he is the leader.</p>
    <p>The republic did have problems that came from the Second Reich.</p>
    <p>The 25 points were a mix of nationalist and religious ideas.</p>
    <p>Hitler turned National Socialism into a force.</p>
    <p>In 1923, Hitler played with politics as the Reich had hyperinflation and French occupation of the Ruhr.</p>
    <p>The SA was integrated into the military, and he was rising in popularity.</p>
    <p>In the plan to march on the Reichstag, he was arrested, and his trial turned him into a national figure.</p>

    <h1>Renaissance of the Nazi Party</h1>
<h1>The Rise of Hitler and the Communist Party</h1>
    <p>When Hitler came to prominence, the Communist Party grew in popularity.</p>
    <p>The Dawes Plan allowed the Weimar Republic to grow.</p>
    <p>Hitler changed his view of being a "drummer" to a man of destiny.</p>
    <p>When there was an attempt to overthrow Hitler in a coup, it further solidified his "self-deification" as the Fuhrer.</p>
    <p>The Nazi Party was rebuilt and institutionalized through party bureaucrats.</p>
    <p>In 1928, Germany's regions were starting to gain Nazi representation.</p>
    <p>Some parties, such as the Nazi Teacher Association, wanted to be their own party.</p>
    <p>"Mein Kampf" explains Hitler's essential principles.</p>
    <p>He linked Jews to Bolshevism and sought to purify the state in ethnic terms.</p>
    <p>In 1927, Hitler was following Italian fascism, but his refusal to sanction trade unions until 1929 slowed his progress.</p>
    <p>Hitler made the urban plan, which involved campaigning in the countryside.</p>
    <p>He focused on land to gain votes.</p>
    <p>The economic crisis of 1930-1933 helped the Nazi Party as they exploited it by blaming Jewish people, along with opposition to a bill.</p>
    <p>In 1930, 6.5 million people voted for the Nazis.</p>
    <p>Mass unemployment and Hitler's pledges helped the Nazi Party win votes.</p>
    <p>They performed well in Protestant and rural districts, offering attractive work to gain support.</p>
    
    <h1>The Road to Power</h1>
    <p>The Weimar Republic had a hyperinflated constitution, so Hitler did not rule the country yet as he was not Chancellor.</p>
    <p>They did not give him the Chancellorship as they did not tolerate his policies.</p>
    <p>Hitler tried to win but lost to Hindenburg in the election.</p>
    <p>The Nazi Party gained around 230 votes due to Bruning being removed.</p>
    <p>Hitler was offered the Vice Chancellor position but was rejected.</p>
    <p>During this time, the Reichstag was dissolved due to both parties not coming to equal terms.</p>
    <p>Strasser left the party in revolt, leading Hitler to consolidate the party by appealing to both sides.</p>
<h1>Hitler's Rise to Power</h1>
    <p>Hitler was given the position of Defense Minister, but he continued to bargain for more powers.</p>
    <p>As Hindenburg would not pass laws favorable towards the people, Hitler was able to take control more easily and rise through the ranks.</p>
    <p>Papen further advanced Hitler's position in the government.</p>
    <p>Hitler's appointment as Chancellor was not inevitable. The republic was weak, so an alliance with the Nazis was seen as a way to help, but it was not effective.</p>
