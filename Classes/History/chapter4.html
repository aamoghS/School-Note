<h1>Result of WWI</h1>
<p>At the culmination of World War I, when the victors convened in Versailles, the European landscape was in turmoil.<br> The mighty empires that once held sway had crumbled, paving the way for nascent states eager to claim their mark. Concurrently, the Communist revolution, initially ignited in Russia, had begun to find resonance in other European territories.<br> Europe, in this post-war aftermath, was grappling with a trinity of crises: the omnipresent specter of starvation, a significant population displaced from their homes, and the devastating blow dealt by the Spanish flu.</p>
<p>Historians remain divided on the effects of the Treaty of Versailles. Some opine that it sowed the seeds for future conflicts, while others argue that those drafting the treaty were out of their depth, failing to fully grasp the complexities and implications of the challenges Europe faced.</p>

<h2>Bold Impact of War on Europe</h2>
<h3>Death Toll</h3>
<p>The ravages of the war were unparalleled in history. A staggering 9 million soldiers, which equates to approximately 15 percent of the total forces, paid the ultimate price. The aftermath of the war wasn't just confined to those who perished. Millions more were left physically and mentally scarred, their lives altered irrevocably.</p>
<p>France, in particular, bore a significant portion of this tragedy. They lost a fifth of their soldiers, leading to the grim moniker of the 'lost generation' for those many souls who never returned home.</p>
<p>Yet, it wasn't just soldiers who faced the brunt of the war. Civilians, too, found themselves in the crosshairs, and the situation was further exacerbated by the Spanish flu pandemic, claiming around 20 million lives.</p>
<h1>Economic Consequences</h1>
<p>The aftermath of the war had profound economic implications:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The war dealt a significant financial blow to Britain, costing them a staggering 34 billion.</li>
    <li>Almost all participating nations had to borrow money to finance the war efforts.</li>
    <li>The USA, recognizing the dire need, lent out a substantial sum of $2,000 million to both Britain and France.</li>
    <li>U-Boats had a severe impact on British trade, sinking an alarming 40 percent of British merchant ships.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Physical Impact on Economy</h3>
<p>The war also left a trail of physical destruction, further exacerbating the economic turmoil:</p>
<ul>
    <li>France bore the brunt of this devastation, with approximately 2 million hectares of its land being rendered unusable.</li>
    <li>Manufacturing faced a downturn as the immediate need to rebuild homes took precedence.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Political Consequences</h1>

<h3>Britain</h3>
<p>Contrary to many European nations, Britain's political fabric remained relatively stable, with no major upheavals post-war.</p>

<h3>Germany</h3>
<p>Germany's political landscape underwent significant changes:</p>
<ul>
    <li>A socialists-led uprising swept the nation.</li>
    <li>The Kaiser abdicated in the wake of these upheavals.</li>
    <li>Friedrich Ebert ascended to leadership, steering Germany through this tumultuous phase.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Russia</h3>
<p>Russia witnessed two major revolutions:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The first led to the establishment of a provisional government.</li>
    <li>The subsequent revolution enabled the Bolsheviks to seize power, leading to a string of dictatorships in its wake.</li>
</ul>

<h3>The Habsburg Empire</h3>
<ul>
    <li>The once-mighty Habsburg Empire disintegrated post-war.</li>
    <li>Following the Kaiser's abdication, the empire was bifurcated into two states.</li>
    <li>Austria and Hungary, spurred by nationalistic sentiments, declared their independence, marking the end of centuries-old dominion.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Turkey</h3>
<p>The political scene in Turkey underwent a sea change:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The sultanate collapsed in 1922.</li>
    <li>Mustafa Kemal Atatürk rose to power, instituting an authoritarian regime that would shape Turkey's trajectory for decades to come.</li>
</ul>
<h1>The Impact of War Outside of Europe</h1>

<h2>America</h2>
<ul>
    <li>The USA emerged from the war as the dominant global economy.</li>
    <li>The USA took over many European markets, aided by its rapid mechanization.</li>
</ul>
<p>President Wilson envisioned a greater role for America post-war, but this sentiment was not widely shared among the American populace.</p>

<h2>Japan and China</h2>
<p>Japan experienced economic prosperity due to its involvement in WWI, finding new markets and avenues for growth.</p>
<p>China sided with the Allies, aiming to exert political and economic influence over Shandong, but these ambitions were thwarted.</p>

<h1>Problems with Peacemakers</h1>
<p>The Versailles Peace Conference was predominantly influenced by the victors of the war.</p>
<ul>
    <li>David Lloyd George - UK</li>
    <li>George Clemenceau - France</li>
    <li>Woodrow Wilson - USA</li>
    <li>Japan focused its energies on the Pacific</li>
    <li>Vittorio Orlando - Italy, concentrated on territorial acquisitions</li>
</ul>
<p>The prevailing instability in Europe necessitated a swift peace settlement, further complicating the process.</p>
<h1>Aims of the Peacemakers</h1>
<p>Woodrow Wilson, with his 14 points, was a beacon of idealism, advocating for a harmonious world. He was firm in his belief that Germany should face repercussions for its actions. His points included:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Abolition of covert diplomacy</li>
    <li>Free maritime navigation for all nations, both during wartime and in peace</li>
    <li>Promotion of free trade between nations</li>
    <li>Universal disarmament</li>
    <li>Colonial populations to have a voice in determining their destinies</li>
    <li>Withdrawal of German forces from Russia</li>
    <li>Reinstating Belgium's independence</li>
    <li>Restoration of Alsace and Lorraine to France</li>
    <li>Realignment of the Austria-Italy border to better reflect nationalities</li>
    <li>Upholding the principle of self-determination for the peoples of Austria-Hungary</li>
    <li>Ensuring Serbia's access to the sea</li>
    <li>Self-determination rights for the denizens of the Turkish Empire and the unobstructed use of the Dardanelles</li>
    <li>Elevation of Poland to an independent state, ensuring its sea access</li>
    <li>Establishment of the League of Nations to safeguard global peace</li>
</ul>
<h2>World Leaders' Views Post-War</h2>

<p>The USA was envisaged as the torchbearer of a new world order, promoting the tenets of democracy and the principle of self-determination.</p>

<p>Clemenceau of France advocated for a stringent settlement against Germany, comprising severe economic and territorial sanctions. The underlying objective was to debilitate Germany and ensure it compensated for the losses inflicted during the war.</p>

<p>David Lloyd George of the UK, while advocating for Germany to relinquish its naval supremacy, hoped for the nation's swift economic recovery and stabilization.</p>

<p>Japan and Italy were inclined towards capitalizing on their wartime advancements. Japan harbored aspirations for global racial equality.</p>

<h2>Armistice Settlement and the Mood Among the German Population</h2>
<p>With the signing of the Armistice, German territories witnessed an occupation by the triumphant Allied forces. This occupation, coupled with General Paul von Hindenburg's sentiments about being "stabbed in the back", instigated the German populace to pinpoint 'internal' adversaries as the culprits for their wartime defeat.</p>

<h2>Popular Sentiment Among the "Victors"</h2>
<p>Clemenceau and George, influenced by the popular clamor, were nudged towards endorsing a more punitive peace settlement against Germany. Vittorio Orlando of Italy faced domestic pressure to annex more territories in Italy's favor.</p>

<p>In the USA, despite President Woodrow Wilson's efforts, the Treaty of Versailles didn't garner the requisite support in the Republican-dominated House and Senate, resulting in its non-ratification.</p>
<h2>Treaty of Versailles</h2>
<p>The Treaty was predominantly perceived as a "diktat" since none of the vanquished powers were accorded a say in its formulation.</p>

<h3>War Guilt</h3>
<p>Germany was mandated to accept the onus of the war, shouldering complete responsibility for its outbreak and ensuing devastation.</p>

<h3>Disarmament</h3>
<p>While the Treaty laid down provisions for disarmament, Germany's military might was capped, limiting its army to a mere 100,000 men. The French had intentions of annexing the Rhineland, but this culminated in the demilitarization of the region instead.</p>

<h2><b>Territorial Changes</b></h2>
<ul>
    <li>Alsace-Lorraine - returned to France</li>
    <li>Saarland - placed under international administration for 15 years, followed by a plebiscite</li>
    <li>Parts of Belgium were decided by a plebiscite</li>
    <li>Germany was partitioned, and Danzig was designated as a free city under international mandate</li>
    <li>Former Russian territories were transformed into new states</li>
</ul>

<h2><b>Mandates</b></h2>
<p>The mandates system necessitated Germany to relinquish its colonies to Allied powers, categorized under “A”, “B”, and “C” sectors.</p> 
<h2><b>Reparations</b></h2>
<p>The Allies demanded reparations from Germany, approximated to be around 6,600 million pounds.</p>

<h2><b>Punishment of War Criminals</b></h2>
<p>The Treaty of Versailles endorsed the prosecution of Kaiser Wilhelm II. However, the Dutch refused to extradite him.</p>

<h2><b>Criticisms of the Treaty of Versailles</b></h2>

<h3><underline>Issue of War Guilt</underline></h3>
<p>The “war guilt” clause was met with vehement opposition from Germany, as they believed multiple nations shared the culpability for the war. This very clause was manipulated by Adolf Hitler, channeling the prevailing resentment to consolidate his political ascendancy.</p>

<h3><underline>Disarmament Clause</underline></h3>
<p>Germany's military was curtailed to a strength of 100,000, while other nations did not face such stringent disarmament obligations.</p>

<h3><underline>Reparations and Loss of Key Resources</underline></h3>
<p>Germany was burdened with exorbitant reparations and was also compelled to forfeit essential resources. This financial strain pushed Germany into the throes of hyperinflation in the early 1920s.</p>

<h3><underline>Issues of Territorial Changes and Self Determination</underline></h3>
<p>The territorial realignment resulted in many Germans living outside the redefined German borders, an offshoot of the dissolution of the German Empire.</p>

<h3><underline>Relinquishing of Colonies</underline></h3>
<p>Under the pretext of liberating territories from Germany's “harsh rule”, its colonies were allocated to other nations.</p>

<h3><underline>League of Nations</underline></h3>
<p>Germany was not extended an invitation to participate in the League of Nations' meetings, a significant oversight given the nation's prominence.</p>
<p><strong>Alternative View of Versailles</strong></p>
<p>Treaty was moderate compared to what Germany imposed on Russia</p>
<p><strong>Treaty left Germany in a strong position in the center of Europe</strong></p>
<p>Germany was not physically undamaged, gained strategic advantage 
other nations were weak due to fighting on their land and new states created</p>
<p>Reparations bill was not responsible for economics 
issue of bank notes caused hyperinflation but they did not pay which caused economic crisis</p>
<p><strong>Issue One:</strong> Treaty was not exceptionally unfair 
Germany used Propaganda and evaded paying reparations which forced Allies to make small revisions</p>
<p><strong>Issue Two:</strong> USA and Britain did not enforce terms of the treaty</p>
<p>Versailles allowed for France to occupy Rhineland</p>
<p><strong>Settlement of Eastern and South-Eastern Europe</strong></p>
<p>Four peace treaties were signed with Austria, Hungary, Bulgaria, and Turkey</p>

<p><strong>Treaty of St Germain (Austria)</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Austria was separated from Hungary</li>
  <li>Austria Lost Bohemia and Moravia - now part of Czechoslovakia</li>
  <li>Austria Lost states which formed Yugoslavia</li>
  <li><span style="color:#7C4DFF;">Poland</span> got Galicia</li>
  <li>Italy gained small lands along the coast</li>
  <li>Austria reduced to 30,000 and lost "Anschluss" (union with Germany)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Treaty of Trianon (Hungary)</strong></p>
<p>Hungary had to recognize the independence of new states, limited to 35,000 men, and pay reparations</p>
<p><strong>Treaty of Neuilly (Bulgaria)</strong></p>
<p>Lost territory to access the Mediterranean but gained land from Turkey</p>

<p><strong>Treaty of Sèvres (Ottoman Empire)</strong></p>
<p>Syria was given to France</p>
<p>Palestine and Iraq were given to Britain</p>
<p>Straits were demilitarized zones</p>
<p>Sultan Muhammad VI accepted, but Kemal rejected; a compromise was made</p>

<p><strong>Treaty of Lausanne (Turkey)</strong></p>
<p>Result of Kemal</p>
<p>Turkey regained land, gained sovereignty over straits</p>
<p>Did not have to pay</p>

<p><strong>Criticisms of Peace Settlements</strong></p>
<p>Racial problems were large in Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia as multiple ethnic groups were displaced within their new countries</p>
<p>New states were weak politically and economically</p>

<p><strong>Treaties Caused Bitterness</strong></p>
<p>Hungary resented the loss in territories</p>
<p>Turkey was bitter about the settlement which led to Kemal overthrowing</p>
<p>Italy was discontent as they expected more land</p>


<p><strong>Impact of War and Peace Treaties</strong></p>
<p>Russia was under Bolshevik dictatorship</p>
<p>New states became frontiers to block Russia</p>
<p>New Europe was divided between victors and defeated, as well as those who wanted peace and those who wanted to revise the treaty</p>

<p><strong>Economic Issues</strong></p>
<p>Bourgeois families were affected due to inflation impacting the middle class</p>
<p>Countries tried to build their economies via tariffs and fierce competition</p>

<p><strong>Social Changes</strong></p>
<p>Traditional structures were swept away as revolutions and new governments distributed land</p>
<p>Trade unions became strong due to the war and were allowed to negotiate for better pay</p>

<p><strong>Impact on Women's Rights</strong></p>
<p><em>Housing Act and Unemployment Insurance Act in Britain</em></p>
<p>Women gained rights:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Changes were seen as 'flappers'.</li>
  <li>Drinking and smoking were not usual "women behavior".</li>
  <li>Women could apply to be lawyers in Britain.</li>
</ul>
<p>Women were gaining the right to vote in multiple countries, but when the war ended, employment opportunities stopped after the war, causing many to return to domestic jobs.</p>

<p><strong>Failure of Collective Security</strong></p>
<p>In the 1920s and 1930s, the League faced many challenges, but the lack of collective action among European nations led to the failure of the League.</p>

<p><strong>Collective Security and League of Nations</strong></p>
<p>The principle of collective security was the idea that peace could be preserved by countries preventing aggression.</p>
<p>If the League couldn't find a resolution, a group would impose moral pressure and economic sanctions.</p>
<p><strong>The Covenant of the League of Nations</strong></p>
<p>The key objective was to achieve peace and avoid future conflicts.</p>
<p>Aimed at promoting international goodwill and cooperation among 32 allied states and 12 neutral states.</p>
<p>USSR was never admitted, and USA never joined.</p>

<p><strong>Dealing with International Disputes</strong></p>
<p>They had a Permanent Court of International Justice, arbitration, and investigation by the council.</p>
<p>If a member failed to follow, then the league would impose economic sanctions.</p>
<p>The military was the last resort, but the league did not have its own armed forces.</p>
