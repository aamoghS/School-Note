    <h1>Hitler's Rise to Power</h1>
    <p>In 1930, Hitler declared that the constitution was only an area of battle rather than a goal for the state. Hitler was appointed chancellor by Hindenburg under Article 48. His immediate aim was to secure power, but he wanted to preserve a camouflage of legality by repeating the idea of a legal revolution and unity.</p>

    <p>Hitler had several advantages when Papen thought he had control over Hitler. Goring and Frick were ministries of interior in Prussia and the Reich. Papen's deposition of Prussia had weakened opposition, and Hitler was about to exploit the state of emergency. He invoked Article 48, which gave the president the authority to issue emergency decrees.</p>

    <p>Hitler was a politician heading a mass party on the right, and the party was loyal to Hitler. The dissolution of the Reichstag and the election of March 5, 1933, was a pivotal moment. Hitler's first aim was to eliminate the Reichstag. He rejected a pact with the Center Party as it would allow him to get a working majority and secure cabinet agreement. The Nazis later conducted an electoral campaign in which Hitler hid his real intentions behind the guise of an "appalling inheritance" and the danger of the Communist Party.</p>

    <p>He appealed to conservatives by taking Christianity as the basis of morality and emphasizing that the family is the foundation of the nation and state. His economic plans were vague, like the Four-Year Plan, but he did mention saving farmers and addressing the unemployment problem.</p>

    <p>During the election campaign, Hitler laid the foundation of Nazi dictatorship in February. Meanwhile, the government prohibited political meetings and banned newspapers. Two days after this, the Reich's grip on Prussia grew due to the dissolution of the Prussian Landtag. Goring began a systematic purge of the civil service and police, with 3/5 of the police being required to support the Nazi party and enroll as auxiliary police.</p>

    <p>The communist threat played a major role in the Nazi campaign. The Nazis wanted to frame the communists, so they raided the Communist Party headquarters. The Reichstag fire allowed Hitler to exploit the Red threat, which was started by a Dutch communist, Marinus van der Lubbe.</p>

    <p>Frick signed a decree for the protection of people and the state, which empowered the central government by allowing the arrest of individuals at will and the censorship of private houses. State governments could not restore public security. This decree gave Hitler sufficient power and ensured that the government did not face significant opposition.</p>

    <h1>Hitler's Rise to Power</h1>
    <h2>Hitler's Coalition with Generals</h2>
    <p>Hitler started to forge a de facto coalition with generals for his unofficial government to be based on. In a dinner organized by Kurt, Hitler outlined his full plans of rearmament and won recognition that "at any rate no chancellor has ever expressed himself so warmly in favor of defense." Anti-socialism was appreciated by big business and was able to win campaign funds for anti-democratic and anti-socialist nature. However, Hitler did not win the election, as the Nazi Party received only 43.9% of the vote. The Nazi Party suffered defeats in Bavaria, Baden, Wurttemberg, Hesse, and Saxony.</p>

    <h2>The Enabling Act and Revolution</h2>
    <p>The election results led to a burst of revolutionary activity, allowing the Nazis to take physical control. The revolution from "below" allowed Hitler to neutralize his opponents and force non-Nazi governments to resign. He initially resorted to Nazi violence but later appealed to the SA and SS to end violence in the business world. Goring, on the other hand, contradicted what he said, so Hitler had to retract his statement. The Nazis continued to seize administrative positions, raising fears that the German bureaucracy would be replaced by Nazis. To counter this, the Law of Restoration was passed, preserving the existence of the traditional state bureaucracy.</p>

    <h2>The Enabling Act</h2>
    <p>On March 21, Hitler celebrated the opening of the Reichstag in the presence of the crown prince and the military establishment of the ancient regime. The Reichstag considered the Enabling Bill, aiming to legalize the transfer of full legislative and executive power to the cabinet for 4 years. For this to happen, the government had to secure a two-thirds majority. Hitler would lock his enemies in and needed support from the Centre Party, which gave him the votes in exchange for influencing him.</p>

    <p>The debate had the atmosphere of a coup d'etat as the space was packed with Nazi supporters. Hitler asserted that the president, churches, and states (Länder) would not be impaired by the bill but also stated that he was ready to use hostilities if it failed. The terror and pledges won Hitler the two-thirds majority, with only the SPD voting against it. The Enabling Act had propaganda value as it created pseudo-legality that inhibited Nazi opponents and confused them.</p>

    <h2>Process of Gleichschaltung</h2>
    <p>Hitler rapidly completed the process of bringing the states (Länder) under the new socialist regime prior to the Enabling Act.</p>

    <h1>The Rise of the National Socialist Reich</h1>

    <h2>Consolidation of Power</h2>
    <p>The National Socialist Reich took over police forces and reconstituted the Reichstag with the Reich government having full powers. Diets were abolished, and all state governments were subordinated to the Reich government.</p>

    <h2>Trade Unions and Opposition</h2>
    <p>One of Hitler's formidable opponents was the trade unions, which had previously defeated the Kapp Putsch by calling a general strike. However, many were shell-shocked by the economic slump. Leaders of the socialist unions wanted to salvage essentials for their organization and did not meddle in politics, focusing on protecting economic and social welfare. Goebbels outmaneuvered union leadership by appealing over its head to workers. The SA and SS occupied trade unions, and workers were enrolled in the new German Labor Front (DAF). Hitler controlled the group by fixing wages and putting trustees of labor in charge of the Ministry of Labor. The Labor Front became the national community to which employers would belong.</p>

    <h2>Political Parties and Dissolution</h2>
    <p>The left-wing was dissolved quickly, but the right-wing integrated into the Nazi party. The Law against the New Formation of Parties confirmed the dissolution of political parties and made the Nazi party the only legal party. The death of Ernst Röhm served as a reminder of the consequences of political dissent.</p>

    <h2>Control of Education and Media</h2>
    <p>The Nazi control of education, media, and cultural life was facilitated by Goebbels, who controlled broadcasting and imposed uniform news coverage. Intellectual workers were forced to join the Reich Chamber of Culture, subject to rigorous checks on their activities. All teachers were affiliated with the Socialist Teacher Organization. Nazi teenagers who terrorized the left had to resign.</p>

    <h2>Relations with Big Business</h2>
    <p>Alfred Hugenberg campaigned for the Nazi cartel and the enhancement of small-scale businesses. Hitler needed a solution to stop the attack on big business. Hugenberg was replaced as economic minister to appease big businesses. An employer association created the Reich Estate of German Industry, with Krupp as a leader. Krupp argued that German industry should pay Hitler because he allowed trade unions to be disrupted, and making voluntary donations could secure more favorable conditions later. These businesses indirectly supported the move towards independence.</p>

    <h2>The Churches</h2>
    <p>The Church was willing to negotiate to preserve its independence. A Concordat was signed, granting the Church advantages it did not have in the Weimar Republic. It guaranteed religious freedom, the ability to administer itself, appoint its clergy, and enjoy privileges throughout the Reich. Parents could demand Catholic schools.</p>

    <h1>Hitler's Rise and Consolidation of Power</h1>

    <h2>Hitler and the Church</h2>
    <p>Hitler viewed the Concordat as a temporary measure to end church involvement in politics. Article 31 sought to distinguish between Catholic organizations and those with a professional purpose, but it led to growing friction between the two sides. Twenty-eight regional Protestant groups opposed Hitler's efforts to create a united church, as it intermingled religion and politics. The failed coordination among German Protestants forced them to navigate between cooperating and maintaining a degree of independence.</p>

    <h2>The Defeat of the Second Revolution</h2>
    <p>The legal revolution preserved the military and elites. Nazi activists sought to seize power for economic benefits and access to new posts, but the party did not have the same monopoly as the Communist Party did. Within the party structure, Ernst Röhm posed a challenge to Hitler due to opposing ideas. Röhm did not accept that the legal revolution was over and expanded the SA. The SA, larger than the SS, posed a threat to Hitler, leading to a confrontation.</p>

    <p>Hitler preferred the Reichswehr as he wanted to start rearming, while Röhm wanted to expand the SA. The SA could be seen as a threat to the military, which Hitler wanted to avoid. Hitler began to confront the SA and Röhm, relieving the SA by sending its members on leave. Goebbels attempted to prevent a speech by Jung, who mentioned a second revolution, but it was leaked to the public.</p>

    <p>During the Night of the Long Knives, Jung was arrested, right-wing critics were killed, Röhm was killed, along with around 85 people. Hitler's popularity was declining, but when Hindenburg died, he combined the roles of Chancellor and President. The SA and populist part had to accept the Nazi revolution.</p>

    <h2>The Nazi Government and Policies</h2>
    <p>The Nazi Party failed to dictate policy in the same way the Bolshevik Party did in Russia. Hitler had no immediate blueprint for the Nazi state and relied on Article 48 to issue 28 emergency decrees. There was no purge, and Hitler appeared to be controlled by the conservative party.</p>

    <p>The Nazi Party grew within the government, and the Enabling Act was strengthened as Hitler took charge. Article 3 allowed him to independently pass laws, and cabinet meetings declined.</p>

    <h1>The Consolidation of the Nazi Regime</h1>

    <h2>Enabling Act and Centralization</h2>
    <p>The Enabling Act strengthened the central government and ended the independence of the states (Länder). Reich organizations were specifically selected to report directly to Hitler. Hitler's road-building experience was utilized for the Autobahn program, and he oversaw the Hitler Youth program. Göring built a lot of power and became Minister Supremo.</p>

    <h2>Himmler and the SS State</h2>
    <p>In 1929, Himmler took over the SS, which became more than the SA, serving as a loyal and disciplined elite. Himmler also played a role in eliminating Röhm and SA leaders. The SS operated independently and controlled concentration camps. Himmler's control over the police grew, and he was given control of the Gestapo. He was appointed Chief of German Police, confirming his dual command over the SS and police forces. The fusion of the SS and police allowed for a brutal campaign against Jewish citizens.</p>

    <h2>Centralization of the Reich</h2>
    <p>The Law of Reconstruction marked a radical change as assemblies were abolished, and governments were subordinated to the Reich. Germany became a strong, nationally centralized country. However, Hitler started to back away from a fully centralized administrative system and conceded the possibility of having state ministers. The last major reform was the Municipal Code, which granted mayors dictatorial powers appointed by the state from the party.</p>

    <h2>Civil Service and the Law of Resaturation</h2>
    <p>The Law of Resaturation allowed for the purge of Jewish and other individuals from the civil service.</p>

    <h1>The Nazi Party and Hitler's Role</h1>

    <h2>Civil Service and Occupied Lands</h2>
    <p>The civil service had the objective to support the party and was excluded from the newly occupied lands during 1938-39.</p>

    <h2>The Nazi Party</h2>
    <p>The NSDAP's role was far from clear, with disagreements. Hitler was determined to prevent the party from exerting too much influence to challenge his own power. Although he had Hess as his deputy, Hitler aimed to integrate the SA and the party into the state, stating that the party had become a state power in the teaching government. Laws were enacted to ensure unity between the party and the state. Hitler stated that the main task of the party was to carry out propaganda and indoctrination.</p>

    <p>The party's influence over the state was weak, as some ministers defended their departments as a check to prevent the party from growing. The state evolved from the growth of the SS and the radicalization of the party during the war.</p>

    <h2>Role of Hitler</h2>
    <p>In his own theory, Hitler saw himself as the all-powerful Fuhrer. Cabinet parleys were infrequent to prevent his deposition, and the Reichstag's powers were reduced. Hitler disliked paperwork, preferring to let events take their course and leaving officials to interpret his vague and elastic decisions themselves. The Third Reich was chaotic due to overlapping responsibilities, and Hitler deliberately encouraged rivalry among his supporters, creating chaos within his charismatic rule. Hitler did not want to be involved in day-to-day matters but remained charismatic. He was not a weak dictator, but his regime was unstable.</p>

    <h2>Revival of Party Influence</h2>
    <p>In 1938, there was an increasing radicalization as the party intensified its campaign against Jewish citizens. Joachim von Ribbentrop was appointed to break the grip of traditional diplomats and gave the department a Nazi outlook. Blomberg committed the army to take an oath of loyalty to Hitler but was called out as a homosexual. Schacht resigned as his plans were against Hitler's policies. The Anschluss of Austria increased power and influence over the party. The Nazis seized power effectively through conquest and did not make concessions to the old elites.</p>
