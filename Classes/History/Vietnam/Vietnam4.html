  <h1>War in Cambodia</h1>

  <p>President Nixon's campaign promised to reduce combat troops during peace talks.</p>

  <p>The president had little choice but to fulfill his promises and met with President Thieu, announcing the withdrawal of 25,000 troops. Nixon, however, had no intention of abandoning Saigon and committed to confining the American role to an air war.</p>

  <p>There was nothing to prevent the president from restarting air bombing. Nixon's decision to bomb Cambodia marked a significant development in his first year in office. The objective was to widen the conflict by attacking communist sanctuaries, with the hope of easing military pressure and demonstrating that the USA was prepared to support diplomacy with force.</p>

  <p>Vietminh operations had been a provocation to Americans. Phnom Penh was supposed to be neutral, but the prince tolerated communism. Although not pro-communist, the prince turned a blind eye to violations to prevent war.</p>

  <p>Hanoi aimed to restrain Vietminh support for indigenous communists, who were relatively few in numbers and had established the communist party in 1960. This movement was preceded by Issarak and associated with a provisional government in 1951. Hanoi provided aid and advice to opposition forces while taking precautions by cultivating ties with China.</p>

  <p>China tempered Hanoi's designs on Cambodia and served as a counterweight to the rising influence of America in Southeast Asia. By late 1960, Cambodia's strategy was breaking down due to the cultural revolution causing internal political turmoil. The North Vietnam build-up drew Cambodia deeper into the war, and General Westmoreland recommended ground attacks across the border.</p>

  <p>There was a risk to Cambodia, as Prince Sihanouk leaned towards the US and made it known he was prepared to allow Americans in hot pursuit. South Vietnamese sabotage was minimal, and the prince feared that a communist victory would mean a loss of independence.</p>

  <p>In 1969, a new president had a different idea about Cambodia. Nixon preferred air power, allowing attacks without disturbing existing plans. He ordered the bombing to begin in March, intending it to be long instead of short and confidential. However, the story leaked to The New York Times.</p>

  <p>The response was to arrange wiretapping in an effort to plug the leak, a move of questionable legality among many.</p>

  <h1>Cambodia: The Unfolding Tragedy</h1>

  <p>The worst was yet to come for Cambodia. A year after the bombing, B-52 airstrikes failed to eliminate the sanctuaries. Instead, the air raids compelled the Vietminh and Vietcong to retreat deeper into Cambodian territory. In response to Sihanouk's turnabout, Hanoi armed Cambodian communists, sparking a new uprising against Penh that gained some outside support.</p>

  <p>The army's disaffection signaled the end of Sihanouk's usefulness. Lon Nol orchestrated a right-wing coup, with allegations of CIA involvement, though clear evidence remains elusive.</p>

  <p>In the period of 1969-1970, the fate of the Khmer Rouge was uncertain. The Nixon administration announced troop withdrawals and introduced the Nixon Doctrine, emphasizing U.S. willingness to provide assistance to allies without committing troops. The message was clear: U.S. allies needed to help themselves, and the U.S. aimed to reduce its role as the global gendarme.</p>

  <p>The concept of peace talks in 1970 laid the framework for official discussions away from the public eye. On April 20, Nixon announced the intention to bring home 150,000 troops, only to reverse the plan later. Nixon appeared on television, revealing that the U.S. and South Vietnam would be crossing into Cambodia.</p>

  <p>The goal was to locate COSVN and communists with the backing of B-52 airstrikes. Although the administration described the undertaking as an incursion, it amounted to an invasion, widening the conflict despite the ongoing U.S. withdrawal. The immediate goal was not achieved.</p>

  <p>The invasion and bombing inflicted devastating effects on Cambodian society. The rural population abandoned the countryside to escape air raids, causing the population of Phnom Penh to surge from 600,000 to 2 million. Cities were filled with people who had forsaken their homes and crops.</p>

  <p>Widespread starvation ensued, and the bombing had a profound impact on the Khmer Rouge. Their plans for Cambodia were unclear, transforming them into a significant fighting force. Westerners viewed them as emerging unexpectedly, questioning their impact without Hanoi. In the short term, their focus was on combating the pro-American government. However, the more punishment they endured, the more paranoid they became, suspecting everyone.</p>

  <h1>Khmer Rouge Atrocities and the Impact on America</h1>

  <p>The Khmer Rouge's atrocities would reach genocidal proportions, and Americans had contributed to this grim reality. William, a student of crisis, argues that U.S. policies were instrumental in creating the conditions that allowed such horrors to unfold.</p>

  <p>The bombing and invasion uprooted the rural population, fueling the Khmer Rouge's urge for revenge against Lon Nol collaborators. The bombing finally ceased in 1973 after the removal of U.S. combat troops, insisted upon by the U.S. Congress.</p>

  <h2>Title: Protest</h2>

  <p>The invasion activated the anti-war movement in the United States. The broadening of the war contradicted Nixon's plans for bringing troops home and seemed to portend major reversals of policy, leading to a tragic outcome in America. In May 1970, the National Guard shot four students, resulting in student strikes that closed 400 universities and colleges.</p>

  <p>The Nixon administration responded to the Kent State killings by attributing them to violent dissent. The president also ordered the surveillance of critics. Protests developed within the armed forces, taking various forms. Anti-war troops carried out attacks against pro-war individuals, using fragmentation grenades to express their reluctance to risk their lives for corrupt governments.</p>

  <p>The stress of fighting led to atrocities against American people claiming to help. American soldiers murdered 400-500 civilians they believed harbored guerrillas. Desertion reached a staggering 89,000 cases.</p>

  <p>As a form of protest against the war, many fled the country. Most sought refuge in Canada, while Sweden became a favored destination. The U.S. government regarded the status of political figures as honorable, but in this case, 10,000 refugees were living outside the U.S. and did not return home. Many believed they had committed a crime when receiving the pardon.</p>

  <h1>The Invasion of Cambodia and its Ramifications</h1>

  <p>The invasion of Cambodia led to massive protests that ultimately ensured the withdrawal of U.S. troops from the country. The administration was reluctant to give the appearance of yielding to street demonstrators.</p>

  <p>Nixon and Kissinger believed that the timely application of force was necessary to spur secret talks, but the Communist response to the Cambodian war was an increase in activities in Laos. In 1971, despite protests from Phouma, American and South Vietnamese forces invaded Laos, violating the Geneva agreement. The American role was limited to providing air support, leading to more anti-war protests, although they were less widespread.</p>

  <p>The Laotian operation served as a test of Vietnamization, but Saigon abandoned the campaign. American press releases spoke of success, but there were concerns about the future as Saigon heavily depended on American support.</p>

  <p>When the Communists attacked in 1972, American and South Vietnamese forces were surprised by the capacity of North Vietnam and the Vietcong. Though the southern forces were outnumbered, they were less spread out, and the Communists attacked on a broad front. Saigon was not defeated, but as the campaign ground to a halt by June, Hanoi had reason to pause and reconsider its situation. The impressive Communist attack did not allow for a swift resolution.</p>

  <p>Another consideration arose as the president made trips to Russia and China. A combination of battlefield developments and Eastern Bloc politicking cleared the way for serious negotiations. Talks between Tho and Kissinger resumed in the summer, and before the November election, they reached terms. All political problems about the future would be left to Vietnam themselves. Kissinger had longstanding objections to the presence of Vietminh troops in the south, and Tho suggested that Thieu could be replaced.</p>

  <p>Americans were bailing out regarding the cost. However, the problem was that the U.S. bargained in secret and reckoned without Thieu. After learning of his objections to the Paris Accords, Thieu knew his chances of surviving were low without the USA. He made the objections public and accused the president of leaving a faithful ally.</p>

  <h1>The Aftermath of Vietnam: Recriminations</h1>

  <p>Nixon, unwilling to lose voters, instructed Kissinger to seek further concessions and bombed North Korea. The communists responded with 1,200 missiles. The entire campaign was unnecessary as Hanoi indicated it would renew talks with the same terms. The Paris Accords allowed the U.S. to withdraw troops, leaving the determination to Hanoi and Saigon.</p>

  <h2>Title: Recriminations</h2>

  <p>The recriminations echoed throughout the land as America attempted to understand what went wrong. Escalation was a key factor, as the U.S. increased its commitment without understanding the long-term consequences. Additionally, there was never a clear-cut decision on the war; a series of small decisions gradually led to the investment of power, and the U.S. found itself in a position of surrender or facing an all-out conflict, possibly leading to nuclear war.</p>

  <p>The portrayal of Vietnam as a mistake is debatable, as it implies that America had the best intentions. This is partially false, as presidents often acted under the guidance of advisors before any major plans. Another rationale for U.S. policy was the belief that South Vietnam was vital, consistent with the American approach to other regions as they attempted to establish influence within the Western bloc.</p>

  <p>To the USA, Vietnam's importance derived from its strategic location. The French had derived wealth from the country, but it was not the main interest for the USA. The Saigon government operated as an oligarchy behind the facade of representative institutions, proving resistant to American efforts at reform. Indo-China's strategic value was the main focus, and the interests of the people in the region were not prioritized.</p>

  <p>Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos bore the consequences of the largest American war, with the Pentagon dropping three million tons of bombs. Over three million U.S. personnel served in the region, and during the same period, American forces rose to over 50% of their levels. Estimates, calculated on the lower side, suggest a combat toll of over 220,000 South Vietnamese soldiers killed.</p>

  <h1>The Human Cost and Aftermath of the Vietnam War</h1>

  <p>Civilian deaths in North and South Vietnam ranged around 400,000, with 4,407 military personnel among the casualties. Many statistics remain uncertain, making a final reckoning nearly impossible.</p>

  <p>In Cambodia, the toll reached hundreds of thousands, if not millions, while the war in Laos, though less intense, also saw internecine conflicts. Despite the level of violence, some in the U.S. believed it had not been enough.</p>

  <p>Many of the student demonstrators abandoned the issue once the troops came home, and the media shifted its focus to other matters. The right-wing took charge of discussions, blaming U.S. politicians for losing the war. The simplistic view portrayed the conflict as a military problem.</p>

  <p>Hanoi faced monumental problems and was uncertain about how to proceed after the end of fighting. Events in Cambodia drew Vietnam into a new war, leading to an occupation from 1978-1989. The U.S. trade embargo exacted a heavy toll, while the USSR faced its own crisis.</p>

  <p>The lack of a conceived plan for the home front proved telling. Uncertain about what to do, leadership retreated from programs that had mobilized the population in the past. Finally, the leadership proved incapable of surrendering its claim to a monopoly on political power, influenced by the war experience and the need for unity against a common foe.</p>

  <p>Hanoi proved more effective in waging war than in governing afterwards, and the country was well on its way to reintegration.</p>
