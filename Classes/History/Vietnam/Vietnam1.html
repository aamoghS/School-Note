<h1>Wars in Indo-China</h1>

<p>Castro presented an opportunity to establish a presence, but the United States and its allies wielded more influence in the Third World.</p>

<p>The Russians employed propaganda and political strategies for the Third World, providing aid. Russia demonstrated greater skill in avoiding direct military action after 1945, with their only full-scale war occurring in Afghanistan in 1979.</p>

<p>Russians were more inclined to engage in movements in Eastern Europe, whereas Western powers deployed armies to Southeast Asia before the USSR ventured into Afghanistan.</p>

<p>Historians argue that the failure to neutralize the Cuban revolution influenced Washington's policy towards the Third World. Following Cuba, the Kennedy and Johnson administrations opted for a greater emphasis on covert operations against revolutionaries, supporting governments friendly to the USA.</p>

<p>The objective was to counter communist promises of land reforms and to humble the rich and powerful. The Bay of Pigs incident highlighted that the USA had much to learn, and the failure to do so invited Soviet interference.</p>

<p>Washington refrained from using direct military force, instead emphasizing long-term, more impactful techniques. The Dominican crisis presented a military option, but Indo-China revealed the extent to which Americans were willing to go. While South Vietnam focused on counter-insurgency, the war involved millions of American military personnel. The conflicts in Indo-China were significant encounters between the First World and the Third World.</p>

<h1>Diem</h1>

<p>As the French withdrew from Indo-China, the challenge for the USA was to establish a stable anti-communist government in South Vietnam. Washington struggled to align itself with the new regime, especially since a pro-Western government would find it difficult to counter communist accusations of foreign domination following the expulsion of the French.</p>

<p>The Eisenhower Administration had to support a local leader who emerged from the chaotic Vietnamese political system in the south. Both the French and Vietminh worked to eliminate non-communist nationalists, aiming to retain Indo-China as a colony and intimidate potential competitors.</p>

<p>There was no popular acclaim for Ho Chi Minh; instead, Bao Dai's new minister assumed power more due to self-promotion than popular demand. Diem faced the challenge of garnering support for the Saigon government.</p>

<p>Diem, born into a Catholic family in the Vietnamese royal court, initially contemplated a career as a priest but ultimately pursued an administrative path. He was appointed as a provincial chief but faced trouble and had to resign over conflicts with the French.</p>

<p>During World War II, Vichy French were allowed to remain in Indo-China. Some nationalists collaborated with the Japanese against Western powers, particularly in Vietnam with the French. Guerrilla warfare patriots rose, but Diem remained aloof and failed to establish nationalist credentials among the masses as Ho Chi Minh did.</p>

<p>Diem could never overcome his reluctance to mix with the common people and demanded obedience as one born to rule. During the last days of the Pacific wars, Diem, being too independent for the Japanese, was not chosen to join the new government. In 1945, communists took him captive and exiled him until 1946. Despite modest efforts to attract a following, he had limited success.</p>

<p>In 1950, Diem left for the USA and sought safety in exile. Outside of Vietnam, he utilized his time to promote his cause, making important connections with Americans such as future President JFK and Francis Cardinal. While insufficient to secure official support from Washington, it paved the way for the future.</p>

<p>In 1953, Diem took up residence at a monastery in Belgium, serving as a base for political activity. He became known among Vietnamese exiles in France. When Bao Dai needed a new prime minister, Diem was available.</p>

<p>Following the outcome of the Geneva conference, France would no longer support the Saigon government. Diem had connections in the USA, and his brother Ngo Dinh Nhu formed a political coalition in Vietnam, establishing a new government. Diem did not gain widespread influence, primarily appealing to Catholics. On June 18, 1954, the emperor appointed Diem as prime minister, greeted by a few hundred people.</p>

<p>The USA committed an initial installment of $300 million in assistance to the new regime, with Dulles viewing aid as the best way to stabilize the country. Vietnam faced chaos with army generals and groups, such as the Binh Xuyen (a group of 40,000 terrorists).</p>

<p>The Americans perceived the problem as needing Diem as much as Diem needed them, given his potential to blackmail for money. Diem surrounded himself with friends and relatives, virtually excluding other political groups, leading to the rise of a new dynasty.</p>

<h1>Diem's Government and Indo-China Crisis</h1>

<p>While Diem's government was plagued by corruption, he himself was not extensively corrupt. However, his policies alienated a broad base of support, such as demanding peasants to pay for properties.</p>

<p>Despite advice from USA experts, Diem ignored their ideas and believed that having large landowners was crucial for the country's support. Saigon attempted to establish agrovilles (strategic hamlets) to move peasants into defensible villages and protect them from communist guerrillas. However, this plan resulted in uprooting ill-will towards Saigon, with agroville residents forced to work without pay, viewing the communist threat solely from a military security perspective.</p>

<p>The regime lasted for 9 years until 1963. Diem gained votes through persistence and facing up to the threat of an army coup in the early days of his government. By the spring of 1955, Xuyen was defeated, and Diem unleashed attacks on rebellious religious sects.</p>

<p>Although not receptive to USA advice, Diem was helped by the USA in establishing the regime in 1954-55. Landsdale arrived in 1954 to assist Diem, training Vietnamese commandos. In late 1955, Lansdale worked with Diem to rig a referendum on the dissolution of the monarchy and the election of the president, where Diem purportedly won 98 per cent of votes, a result scarcely more credible than one-party states.</p>

<p>Lansdale's activities alone did not guarantee the stability of the Saigon government, but they reflected USA intentions, violating pledges though not officially signing them. Diem solidified his authority by ordering 100,000 to retreat north, making it easier for Saigon to secure a military position. Diem attempted to cancel elections and reunify the country, as Ho had little diplomatic leverage. The USSR and China were unwilling to make an issue of the election, with China facing internal problems and the USSR dealing with rebellion in Eastern Europe.</p>

<p>Indo-China was not a priority for the USSR, evident when introducing the north and south as different countries. After the Geneva Conference, millions fled south.</p>

<p>The crisis over land reform dated back to the withdrawal of the French and the arrival of Diem. The problem for Ho Chi Minh was how to maintain a united front for all classes to fight the war while responding to the peasantry's aspirations for land.</p>

<p>Vietminh supporters included many members of the rich peasantry and others from privileged classes opposed to foreign rule, aligning with the poorest peasants and positioned to assume leadership roles.</p>

<h1>Class Interests and Struggles in Vietnam</h1>

<p>On the other hand, the class interests were distinct from the majority of people, and the result was that Hanoi compromised to avoid alienating them. By 1950, the need to mobilize for final victory was evident, and it was time to correct anomalies. The poor and lower-class peasants constituted 60 per cent of the population, providing manpower for the regular army and guerrilla forces.</p>

<p>There was a contradiction between Hanoi's need for unity and the majority's question for land. Ho and his colleagues were prepared to resolve the matter, ordering full implementation, but it led to violent disturbances. Cadres made errors in classifying people as loyal and disloyal, leading to crimes in punishing alleged enemies. Peasants seized the opportunity to advance their economic fortunes by taking property from those who opposed Vietminh. Agricultural reform included staged show trials and executions.</p>

<p>Hanoi had to intervene to salvage what was left, resulting in further trouble. In Ho Chi's own birthplace, there was the most trouble, with thousands of people imprisoned. Ho admitted that the plan to accelerate land reform was a mistake.</p>

<p>The new regime was off to a bad start, preventing Ho from focusing completely on events in the south. Rice shortages and sabotage compounded his problems. In the Geneva accords, Ho ordered Vietcong to organize new fighting units and established the Ho Chi Minh Trail, a network of paths and roads through the jungles of Laos and Cambodia, serving as a route to the south.</p>

<p>These measures were precautionary, as Hanoi did not fully recover from the war while Diem made important gains against guerrillas. Some Vietcong launched attacks without Ho's orders. By 1959, Hanoi agreed to permit strikes, resulting in government officials being killed in the south due to Vietcong actions. While this could be seen as terrorism, communists were selective in their use of force.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the Saigon army bombarded whole villages indiscriminately. The US supplied Diem's troops with modern arms, while Ho's army had outdated weapons and had to withdraw its forces. Diem's repressive tactics and corruption began to catch up with him. In 1960, he clamped down on journalists and other opinion leaders, arresting them and closing opposition newspapers. In November, a small number of disaffected army officers ordered their troops to attack the presidential palace.</p>

<p>Hanoi organized the National Liberation Front in the south, which, although communist-dominated, unified anti-Saigon forces.</p>
