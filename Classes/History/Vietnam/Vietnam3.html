  <h1>Escalation</h1>

  <p>The decision to seek military intervention was most evident in the failure between the USA and Hanoi.</p>

  <p>Seaborn persisted after the Tonkin incident, but no tangible results were achieved.</p>

  <p>The Secretary-General of the United Nations, U Thant of Burma, aimed to organize talks similar to those initiated by Khrushchev.</p>

  <p>Russia perceived war as a threat to peaceful co-existence, especially in the aftermath of the Cuban missile crisis. Their objective was to curtail Hanoi's incessant demands for more aid. U Thant succeeded in persuading the Soviets to act as intermediaries to the Vietminh.</p>

  <p>The latter was receptive, considering the Soviet Union as the primary source of modern weapons, and its word had to be taken seriously.</p>

  <p>China, on the other hand, served as a supply source but lacked modern weaponry.</p>

  <p>U Thant did receive a message from North Vietnam, but the Johnson administration did not wish to pursue it.</p>

  <p>In 1964, guerrillas organized the People's Revolutionary Army with approximately 170,000 members.</p>

  <p>The South's war efforts were faltering until a stable government emerged in 1965 under Nguyen Cao Ky.</p>

  <p>Under American pressure, they held elections for a constitutional assembly. The constitution was ready by 1967, and voting for the legislature and presidency took place, but in a new regime.</p>

  <p>The generals went through elections, mainly appeasing the Americans, and ten civilian candidates were allowed to run, although they had little chance.</p>

  <p>In 1964, Saigon was far from settled. The significant problem was how to bolster the war effort.</p>

  <p>The US administration proceeded to take over the conduct of the war. LBJ did not act immediately, as he did not wish to alarm voters before the presidential election.</p>

  <p>On November 1, a hundred guerrillas raided the airfield at Bien Hoa, north of Saigon. They destroyed six B-57 bombers and damaged others. Johnson held back, but his advisors recommended a gradual escalation of the conflict.</p>

  <p>He authorized additional raids by the South along the northern coast.</p>

  <h1>Vietnam War Escalation</h1>

  <p>When the Vietcong raided Pleiku, eight Americans lost their lives, prompting President LBJ to order the bombing of the North. This strategic move was intended to last for three years, aiming to draw the enemy to the conference table.</p>

  <p>Aleksei was in Hanoi in February to discuss aid for the North and potential compromises. However, the bombing campaign swayed their stance in the opposite direction.</p>

  <p>On February 22, General William Westmoreland requested troop deployment to protect Danang. Initially numbering 3,500 Americans, the advance agents of force would grow to over half a million in the next three years. The public explanation cited Saigon's request for troops, yet they were not informed about it. South Vietnamese generals were cautious, as the presence of US troops reduced Washington's dependency.</p>

  <p>In a speech at Johns Hopkins, President Johnson offered massive economic aid to the North if they abandoned the South. However, this proposal had already been rejected. Numerous peace initiatives were attempted, with the latter being private and involving many intermediaries.</p>

  <p>The Communists insisted on the US leaving the South and allowing it to remain independent, while Hanoi remained firm on the establishment of a neutral coalition government.</p>

  <p>They argued that the USA had no right to intervene, but no peace settlement was reached. From Washington's perspective, the failure of peace initiatives justified the continuation of the war, claiming that they had exhausted all possible options.</p>

  <p>Dean Rusk, the Secretary of State, summed up the situation by stating that the aggressor left no choice, and sending forces became imperative.</p>

  <title>Tet</title>

  <h1>Tet</h1>

  <p>The White House calculated escalation over the next years as generals deemed more troops necessary.</p>

  <p>North Vietnamese operatives were active in the South and played a significant role in the guerrilla war.</p>

  <p>American troops performed adequately but required numerical superiority of 10 to 1 to hold their ground.</p>

  <p>Guerrillas lived off the land and disappeared among the people, waiting to reappear. Many villagers supported them, allowing for assimilation.</p>

  <p>The difficulty of measuring results and the tension of facing enemy troops manifested in the use of drugs. In 1971, Pentagon studies suggested that 30 percent of US troops had experimented with hard drugs such as opium and heroin, while others smoked marijuana.</p>

  <p>The USA aimed to wear down the Communists with attrition, but the Americans proved more vulnerable to prolonged warfare.</p>

  <p>Two or more Americans followed the example of Buddhists and immolated themselves as a protest against the war.</p>

  <p>By 1967, opinion polls indicated that more Americans believed the war was a mistake than supported it. Most Americans believed the war should be prosecuted to victory once the commitment was made.</p>

  <p>The problem was that a military solution proved elusive for both Americans and South Vietnamese. A civil war broke out in 1966 after Nguyen Cao Ky and Lyndon Johnson conferred in Honolulu.</p>

  <p>Ky stalled on questions of returning the country to civilian rule. The election of a constitutional convention did not take place. An alliance of Buddhists and dissident officers started a rebellion, taking control of important cities like Danang and Hue.</p>

  <p>Government forces retook Danang in May and Hue in June, rendering the Buddhists no longer a political force. The South left many Americans wondering what they were fighting for. Elections took place, but a small civil war forced military governments to agree.</p>

  <p>The turmoil meant that the United States assumed a larger responsibility for the war against Communists. In 1967, the Communists attacked at several points in the central highlands of Vietnam and border areas of Laos and Cambodia.</p>

  <p>The campaign was away from major towns and cities, with major battles developing at Khe Sanh. Khe Sanh was deemed important as the Communists chose to make it so. They sent 40,000 troops to the scene, and the US reinforced the base, conducting bombings.</p>

  <p>10,000 Viet Minh were killed compared to 500 Americans, but Khe Sanh and other battles were feints designed to draw US and South Vietnamese troops away from important targets.</p>

  <p>Tet was the Vietnamese Lunar New Year, and the Communists pledged to observe it during the celebration. In January 1968, the Viet Minh and Vietcong attacked Saigon and a hundred other cities in the South.</p>

  <title>Tet Offensive Aftermath</title>

  <h1>Tet Offensive Aftermath</h1>

  <p>During the Tet Offensive, the Communist forces broke into the compound of the US embassy. Parts of Saigon were briefly held, and Hue remained under their control for 25 days.</p>

  <p>The Communists were defeated in terms of taking and holding their targets, but they effectively controlled the countryside. Hanoi had hoped that Tet would inspire an uprising and result in the toppling of Thieu, but this did not come to pass. Nevertheless, an uprising was more of a hope than a definite expectation, and the Communists could be satisfied as they sent a major shockwave through Vietnam and the USA.</p>

  <p>For months, the US command sent optimistic reports to the White House. General Westmoreland described Tet as a sign of desperation on the Communist part, one last effort to win. However, after the aftermath, he saw no need to request more troops for Tet.</p>

  <p>The US Joint Chiefs of Staff and their chairman saw the Tet Offensive as an opportunity to call up some reserves. These were troops who usually trained in the US itself and were not subject to duty abroad except in emergencies.</p>

  <p>The Joint Chiefs of Staff wanted to deploy them to make up for the depletion of regular military forces. Vietnam absorbed equipment and personnel from US bases around the world, causing the Pentagon to doubt its capacity to meet global commitments. A crisis in Vietnam forced the issue and induced the President to comply with their wishes.</p>

  <p>General Wheeler prevailed upon General Westmoreland to request additional help, with the total figure set at 206,000 more troops. To convince the President, Wheeler had to downplay Westmoreland's initial reports from the field. Raising troops would mean bleeding into reserves, and there would be a political price for Johnson.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, the general admitted that they could not guarantee military victory. The Pentagon recommended the US mobilize at the same time as an election year. The war had exacerbated the rate of inflation. It was a fact that opinion polls during the Tet crisis indicated that the American public favored a stronger military response, but it was a case that Johnson was standing with.</p>

  <title>Dramatic Turnabout and Nixon</title>

  <h1>Dramatic Turnabout and Nixon</h1>

  <p>The scene was set for a dramatic turnabout in the course of the war.</p>

  <p>More important than public opinion was the disillusionment of close advisers, such as McNamara, who had predicted victory. The media tended to be more critical of possibilities in Vietnam than the public at large.</p>

  <p>On March 10, the story of troop requests leaked to the press. McCarthy won twenty of twenty-four delegates to the Democratic Party nominating convention in New Hampshire, and in some US states.</p>

  <p>On the 16th, Kennedy from New York, the brother of the slain president, entered the race. Tet had already moved the President to reconsider his position. Before New Hampshire, he ordered Clifford to gather a study group to consider the troop request and the entire course of the war. Clifford initially advocated a firm stand but in spring concluded that the war could not be won except disproportionately to whatever might be gained.</p>

  <p>The impact on Johnson was devastating; he announced the suspension of all bombing north of the 19th parallel. This would free most of North Vietnam from the air threat and confine the bombing to enemy strongholds in the South. He also announced he would not run for the presidency, becoming the target of anti-war sentiments and wishing to save the country from divisiveness. Oswald was the alleged assassin of John Kennedy.</p>

  <p>Hanoi, disappointed that the costly Tet campaign had not led to a general uprising against Saigon, responded favorably.</p>

  <h2>Nixon</h2>

  <p>Johnson's withdrawal from the presidential race did not remove him as an influence on events. His goal was to assure the nomination of a successor who would continue the basic approach.</p>

  <p>Tet had forced him to negotiate; he intended to bargain for the autonomy of South Vietnam as a separate pro-Western political entity. He would resist Hanoi's demand for a coalition government, such as Vietcong, could be formed. The President saw both proposals as the first steps towards a Communist takeover in the South.</p>

  <p>Johnson confided in his closest allies that he would accept a call from the Democratic Party to run despite the de facto resignation.</p>

  <h1>Nixon's Presidency and Vietnamization</h1>

  <p>Following Lyndon B. Johnson's withdrawal from the presidential race, his vice president, Hubert Humphrey, became the administration candidate. In June, an assassin named Robert removed the most popular anti-war democrat, McCarthy, leaving Humphrey as the primary contender.</p>

  <p>LBJ's problem was that he favored more compromise on Vietnam as a way of heading off McCarthy's forces, so the President was not enthusiastic about his own vice president. Humphrey won the nomination of his party at its Chicago convention in the summer of 1968 but yielded to the President's demand that he make no concessions to the doves.</p>

  <p>The convention was rocked by official reports later described as police riots against anti-war protesters outside in the streets. In the long run, the rioting hurt the anti-war cause by identifying it with radicals and extremists. This played into the hands of Johnson and his successor as they were willing to go farther in compromising on the war.</p>

  <p>Agents from the US military and CIA infiltrated the crowds and acted like agents provocateurs, despite this being illegal, as the CIA's job was to engage in covert activities against threats. The war dragged on, so the White House allowed for the violation of the law. In light of all the events, they preferred a hawkish Republican to a dovish Democrat.</p>

  <p>The nominee was Richard Nixon, Eisenhower’s vice president and supporter of Barry Goldwater. The Republican convention was a sedate affair compared to the Democratic one, and Nixon won the nomination. He also won the election, partly because of George Wallace, a political right figure who competed with Nixon in drawing Democratic votes.</p>

  <p>After Humphrey broke LBJ's policy, Hanoi played Humphrey by offering to admit Saigon to Paris talks. Johnson cooperated and recalled the bombing of the North. Nixon urged Saigon to reject Hanoi's offer, leading to confusion among voters.</p>

  <p>With the new president, Nixon campaigned on "peace with honor" by winding down the ground troops and building up South Vietnamese forces. Once 'Vietnamization' was complete, Nixon would take Americans out. Nixon talked of peace and won votes while saving honor by not abandoning Saigon.</p>

  <p>The Communists had been at war since 1946 and expected the worst. In 1969, Nixon bombed Cambodia in a Communist area, despite it being a neutral country.</p>
